In early 2022 I co-founded RubyTrades a (kind of p2p) non kyc fiat on ramp that allowed users to buy and sell crypto using PayPal. Although it was not as successful as we had hoped it still gained some traction and I learned a lot from it. After that I got interested in Monero. I built MoneroOS a plug and play live operating system that mines monero on boot. I also built MoneroNodeMonitor and some other projects.\nI was always fascinated by cross-chain on chain swaps (like rubic.exchange), so I decided to build something similar, but better.\nWhat is CypherGoat? It is a crypto swap aggregator it automatically finds the best exchange rates from our partnered exchange at no extra cost. You can then perform the swap on that exchange, without ever leaving our website!\nWhy it\u0026rsquo;s cool KYC-Free – No personal verification required. Non-Custodial – Direct to wallet trading (on chain swaps) Open Source – Our web UI is open-source. User-Friendly for Everyone – Unlike other aggregators with complex interfaces, CypherGoat has a clean and simple UI, perfect for both beginners and advanced users. Fast \u0026amp; Seamless – Just pick your tokens, swap, and receive. How it works Using CypherGoat is ridiculously simple:\nChoose your tokens – Select the crypto you want to send the one you want to receive and that the amount you want to swap. Get the Best Rate – CypherGoat \u0026ldquo;scans\u0026rdquo; exchanges and finds the best deal for you. Swap \u0026amp; Receive – Confirm the trade, enter your address, send your funds, and get your swapped crypto in your wallet. Final thoughts Crypto swapping shouldn’t be complicated, and I truly believe CypherGoat makes it easier. If you have thoughts, suggestions, or just want to chat about crypto, let’s connect! You can find me and the growing CypherGoat community on Telegram and Twitter .\n","permalink":"https://4rkal.com/posts/launching-cyphergoat/","summary":"Why I built CypherGoat Ever since I first got into crypto I have been building products to make using crypto easier.

Written in go and uses gin The Web UI that is written in go and uses a combination of HTML, HTMX, tailwindcss, CSS and Javascript in templ templates. Aka the GoTTH stack. It interacts with the api in order to find rates etc. What is extremely cool with this stack and setup is that we are able to produce a single binary with everything included for each part and ship it to the server. On the webui side this is possible since the html is compiled into go code using templ and then shipped with the binary.\nIn this article I will be going through my setup to make it easier for you to make something like this.\nSetup I am using a debian 12 server which will expose my application via cloudflare tunnels. All of the static files are being served via nginx and the api and website binaries are ran as systemd services.\nIn this guide I will show you how I set this up.\nThe setup I have a single folder on my dev machine called cyphergoat: It contains\napi/ web/ builds/ The api folder houses the api source code. The web the website source code.\nAnd the builds houses all of the builds that are deployed to the server.\nTailwind The first real challenge comes with setting up tailwindcss correctly.\nIn my web project I have a static folder specifically for static files. Inside of it I have two files\n/web styles.css tailwind.css The styles.css simply contains:\n@import \u0026#34;tailwindcss\u0026#34;; The tailwind.css file is where tailwind-cli will save it\u0026rsquo;s stuff.\nTo build the tailwind stuff I simply run\nnpx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./static/styles.css -o ./static/tailwind.css --watch (assuming you have tailwind-cli installed)\nIn my header.templ file (the header of all the pages) at the top I have\n\u0026lt;link href=\u0026#34;/static/tailwind.css\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link href=\u0026#34;/static/styles.css\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34;\u0026gt; And the files are being served using echo\u0026rsquo;s e.Static (in my main.go file )\nfunc main(){ e := echo.New() e.Use(middleware.Logger()) e.Use(middleware.Recover()) e.Use(middleware.Secure()) e.Static(\u0026#34;/static\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;static\u0026#34;) // Serves content from static folder. // Rest of the handlers } Server On my server side I have a debian 12 vm running on proxmox.\nIn my users home directory I have a folder with the following contents:\ncyphergoat/ ├── api ├── static/ └── web The static folder contains all of the static files (including tailwind.css and styles.css) and the web and api are the binaries.\nI then have two systemd services for these exectuables:\nThe cg-api.service /etc/systemd/system/cg-api.service\n[Unit] Description=CypherGoat API After=network.target [Service] User=arkal Group=www-data WorkingDirectory=/home/arkal/cyphergoat ExecStart=/home/arkal/cyphergoat/api Restart=always RestartSec=1 [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target And cg-web.service /etc/systemd/system/cg-web.service\n[Unit] Description=CypherGoat Web After=network.target [Service] User=arkal Group=www-data WorkingDirectory=/home/arkal/cyphergoat ExecStart=/home/arkal/cyphergoat/web [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Both are owned by the group www-data (this is probably not necessary for the api), in order to make it easier to serve them via nginx.\nNginx The website is communicating with the api but I still need to make the web-ui accessible.\nI have setup an nginx site with the following configuration: /etc/nginx/sites-available/cg\nserver { server_name cyphergoat.com; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4200; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; } location /static/ { alias /var/www/static/; expires 30d; } # Optional robots.txt location = /robots.txt { root /var/www/static; access_log off; log_not_found off; } listen 80; } I have also setup certbot to have an ssl cert.\nYou can setup certbot by running:\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y Generate the ssl cert:\nsudo certbot --nginx -d cyphergoat.com Read Self host your own website for a more in depth nginx setup.\nCloudflare Tunnels I am currently making my website accessible using cloudflare pages. It is an extremely easy to use port forwarding solution\nTo do this you will need a cloudflare account and a domain pointed to cloudflare.\nFirst head to the Zero Trust Dashboard\nUnder Networks click on Tunnels and then Create a tunnel\nOnce created you should Install and run a connector, follow the instructions on the page for your specific setup.\nAfter the connector is running you should click on the Public Hostname tab and Add a public hostname.\nNow you should see something like this: Fill in the info as I have. The service type should be HTTP and the url should be 127.0.0.1:80 or localhost:80\nObviously there is no reason to make your api publicly accessible when deploying your website.\nDeployment In order to deploy my binaries I went ahead and created a quick bash script:\ncd api go build -o ../builds/ . cd ../web templ generate \u0026amp;\u0026amp; go build -o ../builds/web cmd/main.go cd .. rsync -urvP ./builds/ user@SERVER:/home/user/cyphergoat rsync -urvP ./web/static user@SERVER:/home/user/cyphergoat/ rsync -urvP ./api/coins.json user@SERVER:/user/user/cyphergoat/ The script will build the api, generate the templ files and build the webui and then sends everything over to my server (including the static folder)\nI then ssh into my server\nssh user@ip\nand then restart the services\nsudo systemctl restart cg-api cg-web\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nJoin my free newsletter!

Linux is a family of free and open source operating systems based on the Linux kernel.\nAlthough being completely free (unlike alternatives) Linux currently only has 4.5% of the global desktop operating system market, a very low percentage.\nWhat makes Linux great? The core difference between Linux and other mainstream desktop operating systems (windows, macOS) is the fact that it is free and open source. This allows it to be:\nHighly performant - Linux is often faster and more efficient than its counterparts. Free from spyware and ads - Unlike Windows 11 which is adding ads to the start menu Arguably more secure - Being open source often makes it more secure Endlessly customizable Completely free forever - Because it is published under a free and open source GPL license. and much much more Read The importance of open source software for more information about open source software and it\u0026rsquo;s superiority.\nIf Windows and macOS are like apartments with rules and restrictions on what you can change, then Linux is like a house that you own that you can renovate, decorate and modify any way you like.\nIf Linux is so great why isn\u0026rsquo;t everyone using it? We (all Linux users) can probably agree that the main drawback of Linux is user-friendliness. The average user never cared and will never care about what bootloader their laptop is using.\nThe fun part however is that most people are using Linux, they just don\u0026rsquo;t know it!\nAndroid Android is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world. With a staggering 71% of the global mobile operating system market\nA lesser known fact is that android is based on the Linux kernel.\nSo basically 71% of smartphones are running Linux!\nServers Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top one million web servers\u0026rsquo; operating systems are Linux) It also leads other systems such as mainframe computers, and is used on all of the world\u0026rsquo;s 500 fastest supercomputers.\nThis website is being served from a Linux server.\nThe majority if not all of the websites that you visit every single day are being served from a Linux server.\nIoT and embedded systems Most IoT (Internet Of Things) devices run Linux because of it\u0026rsquo;s lightweight nature and robustness. This article from 2018 suggests that 71% of IoT devices run Linux\nMost embedded systems (smart TV\u0026rsquo;s, routers etc) run Linux\nConclusion Linux is quietly running behind the scenes. It may only capture a small slice of the desktop operating system market but it\u0026rsquo;s a huge player in mobile, server and IoT spaces. In fact a majority of people are using Linux daily without even realizing it! It’s in your phone, your favorite websites and countless devices around you.\nUltimately I highly recommend anyone interested to at least try and play around with Linux (especially if you are in the IT field I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a must)\nPS: this article was written on a Framework 13 running Fedora 40 (Linux)\nJoin my free newsletter Subscribe Weekly Roundup Where I share what I’ve been up to that week, including articles I’ve published, cool finds, tips and tricks, and more!

The final result will look something like this shortr, source code\nThis is a great weekend project especially if you\u0026rsquo;re new to go.\nWhat is a url shortener? A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and shrinks it down into something much shorter and easier to share. Instead of copying and pasting a long string of letters, numbers, and symbols, you get a compact version that leads to the same destination. For example, a long URL like www.somelongwebsite.com/articles/this-is-a-super-long-link could become something like bit.ly/abc123. It\u0026rsquo;s super handy for sharing links on social media, in texts, or anywhere space is limited. And most url shorteners provide analytics like link clicks.\nRequirements Go installed on your system. A code editor, eg vs code, neovim In this project I will be using echo as the http server and the standard html library.\nProject Setup Create a new directory to house our project\nmkdir project-name cd project-name Assuming you have golang installed.\nCreate a new go module (project):\ngo mod init project-name Before we start writing any code we first have to install echo:\ngo get github.com/labstack/echo/v4 Now create a new file called main.go\ntouch main.go And open it in your favorite editor.\nCreating url handlers func main() { e := echo.New() e.Use(middleware.Logger()) e.Use(middleware.Recover()) e.Use(middleware.Secure()) e.GET(\u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, RedirectHandler) e.GET(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, IndexHandler) e.POST(\u0026#34;/submit\u0026#34;, SubmitHandler) e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(\u0026#34;:8080\u0026#34;)) } This will create three different routes/handlers.\nThe /:id, which will redirect the user to the required website\nThe / which will display a url submission form for new urls to be added\nFinally the /submit which will handle url submissions from the form in /\nRedirect Handler The most important part of our application is the redirect handler, which will redirect the user to the url that was specified.\nBefore we create any urls we first have to declare some variables and make a helper function\nIn order to have a random ending to our url. eg /M61YlA, we will create a new function called GenerateRandomString\nconst charset = \u0026#34;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\u0026#34; func generateRandomString(length int) string { seededRand := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano())) var result []byte for i := 0; i \u0026lt; length; i++ { index := seededRand.Intn(len(charset)) result = append(result, charset[index]) } return string(result) } This will select length random characters from the charset. If you want your slugs (urls), to not contain any capital letters, you can remove them from the charset.\nNow we will need to have a place to store all of our links. In this example we will be storing them in memory and not a database.\nCreate a new struct called Link and a map called LinkMap:\ntype Link struct { Id string Url string } var linkMap = map[string]*models.Link{} You can also add some sample data to it.\nvar linkMap = map[string]*Link{ \u0026#34;example\u0026#34;: { Id: \u0026#34;example\u0026#34;, Url: \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34;, }, } Now we can (finally) create our RedirectHandler, which will handle all of the redirects for our url shortener.\nfunc RedirectHandler(c echo.Context) error { id := c.Param(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) link, found := linkMap[id] if !found { return c.String(http.StatusNotFound, \u0026#34;Link not found\u0026#34;) } return c.Redirect(http.StatusMovedPermanently, link.Url) } This function will get the id of the link eg /123 and will look for it in the global LinkMap, if it is not available it will return an error that the link was not found. Otherwise it will redirect the user to the specified url using a 301 Permanently Moved http response code.\nRecap #1 The code so far should look something like this:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;math/rand\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/labstack/echo/v4\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware\u0026#34; ) type Link struct { Id string Url string } const charset = \u0026#34;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\u0026#34; var linkMap = map[string]*Link{ \u0026#34;example\u0026#34;: { Id: \u0026#34;example\u0026#34;, Url: \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34;, }, } func main() { e := echo.New() e.Use(middleware.Logger()) e.Use(middleware.Recover()) e.Use(middleware.Secure()) e.GET(\u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, RedirectHandler) //e.GET(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, IndexHandler) //e.POST(\u0026#34;/submit\u0026#34;, SubmitHandler) e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(\u0026#34;:8080\u0026#34;)) } func RedirectHandler(c echo.Context) error { id := c.Param(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) link, found := linkMap[id] if !found { return c.String(http.StatusNotFound, \u0026#34;Link not found\u0026#34;) } return c.Redirect(http.StatusMovedPermanently, link.Url) } func generateRandomString(length int) string { seededRand := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano())) var result []byte for i := 0; i \u0026lt; length; i++ { index := seededRand.Intn(len(charset)) result = append(result, charset[index]) } return string(result) } Run the server\ngo run . You might also want to install any missing dependencies:\ngo mod tidy If you head to localhost:8080/example you should be redirected to example.com\nSubmission Handlers We will now define two new routes inside of our main function\ne.GET(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, IndexHandler) e.POST(\u0026#34;/submit\u0026#34;, SubmitHandler) These two handlers will handle the default page displayed in / which will contain a form that will be submitted to /submit in a post request.\nFor the IndexHandler our code will look something like this:\nfunc IndexHandler(c echo.Context) error { html := ` \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Submit a new website\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;/submit\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label for=\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Website URL:\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Submit\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Existing Links \u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;` for _, link := range linkMap { html += `\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;/` + link.Id + `\u0026#34;\u0026gt;` + link.Id + `\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;` } html += `\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;` return c.HTML(http.StatusOK, html) } When we visit / a submission for will be rendered, to submit a new website. Under the form we will see all registered links from our Linkmap\nPS it is not recommended that you use html like this. You should be separating the html file or using a library like templ.\nThe submission handler SubmitHandler should look something like this\nfunc SubmitHandler(c echo.Context) error { url := c.FormValue(\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;) if url == \u0026#34;\u0026#34; { return c.String(http.StatusBadRequest, \u0026#34;URL is required\u0026#34;) } if !(len(url) \u0026gt;= 4 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (url[:4] == \u0026#34;http\u0026#34; || url[:5] == \u0026#34;https\u0026#34;)) { url = \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34; + url } id := generateRandomString(8) linkMap[id] = \u0026amp;Link{Id: id, Url: url} return c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) } This handler will take a url from the form that was submitted, do some (simple) input validation and then append it to the linkMap.\nFinal Recap The code for our url shortener is:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;math/rand\u0026#34; \u0026#34;net/http\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/labstack/echo/v4\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware\u0026#34; ) type Link struct { Id string Url string } const charset = \u0026#34;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\u0026#34; var linkMap = map[string]*Link{\u0026#34;example\u0026#34;: {Id: \u0026#34;example\u0026#34;, Url: \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34;}} func main() { e := echo.New() e.Use(middleware.Logger()) e.Use(middleware.Recover()) e.Use(middleware.Secure()) e.GET(\u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, RedirectHandler) e.GET(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, IndexHandler) e.POST(\u0026#34;/submit\u0026#34;, SubmitHandler) e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(\u0026#34;:8080\u0026#34;)) } func generateRandomString(length int) string { seededRand := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano())) var result []byte for i := 0; i \u0026lt; length; i++ { index := seededRand.Intn(len(charset)) result = append(result, charset[index]) } return string(result) } func RedirectHandler(c echo.Context) error { id := c.Param(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) link, found := linkMap[id] if !found { return c.String(http.StatusNotFound, \u0026#34;Link not found\u0026#34;) } return c.Redirect(http.StatusMovedPermanently, link.Url) } func IndexHandler(c echo.Context) error { html := ` \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Submit a new website\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;/submit\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label for=\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Website URL:\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Submit\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Existing Links \u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;` for _, link := range linkMap { html += `\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;/` + link.Id + `\u0026#34;\u0026gt;` + link.Id + `\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;` } html += `\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;` return c.HTML(http.StatusOK, html) } func SubmitHandler(c echo.Context) error { url := c.FormValue(\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;) if url == \u0026#34;\u0026#34; { return c.String(http.StatusBadRequest, \u0026#34;URL is required\u0026#34;) } if !(len(url) \u0026gt;= 4 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (url[:4] == \u0026#34;http\u0026#34; || url[:5] == \u0026#34;https\u0026#34;)) { url = \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34; + url } id := generateRandomString(8) linkMap[id] = \u0026amp;Link{Id: id, Url: url} return c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) } Closing words This is a great small project if you are new to/learning go.\nIt can be very helpful if you extend beyond this tutorial.

For ionos that is 500/hour. Setting up a Sliding Window Limit is very important.\nSetup for gmail I recommend that you use a different gmail account from your personal one.\nThe first thing you will have to do is generate an app password, to do that head to Create and manage app passwords and create a new one called listmonk. Copy the password that is generated and save it somewhere safe.\nNow head over to the listmonk webui\nIn the SMTP tab in settings you will find this:\nClick on the gmail option as circled.\nNow enter your full email address (including @gmail.com) in the username field\nAnd in the password field enter the app password we generated before.\nNow click on the Test connection button in the bottom right corner, enter a test email and click on Send e-mail.\nIf you configured everything correctly you should now get a test message to the email specified.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to save!\nSetup for ionos You should probably generate a new email for the newsletter, eg `newsletter@yourdomain.tld.\nHead over to the listmonk webui\nNow in the SMTP tab in the settings you see this\nThe ionos smtp server settings are:\nHost: smtp.ionos.com\nPort: 465\nTLS: SSL/TLS\nIMPORTANT: If you’re using IONOS UK or another specific regional version, you need to adjust the host name. For example, if you’re on IONOS UK, you should use smtp.ionos.co.uk instead of the global smtp.ionos.com.\nNow in the username field you should enter the full email address newsletter@yourdomain.tld and the password is the normal user password.\nNow to test the connection click on the Test connection button in the bottom right corner, enter a test email and click on Send e-mail.\nIf you configured everything correctly you should now get a test message to the email specified.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to save!\nSliding window limit This is very important to setup when email providers limit the amount of email to be sent per hour or per day. You can access the Sliding window limit in Settings under the performance tab. For ionos I have it set at 500 emails/hour\nExposing via cloudflare tunnels I will be making my instance publicly accessible using cloudflare tunnels.\nTo do this you will need a cloudflare account and a domain pointed to cloudflare.\nFirst head to the Zero Trust Dashboard\nUnder Networks click on Tunnels and then Create a tunnel\nOnce created you should Install and run a connector, follow the instructions on the page for your specific setup.\nAfter the connector is running you should click on the Public Hostname tab and Add a public hostname.\nNow you should see something like this: Fill in the info as I have.\nThe service type should be HTTP and the url should be yourserverurl:9000, in my case that\u0026rsquo;s 127.0.0.1:9000\nNow if you head to the domain that you specified you should see gitea up and running.\nIn my case you can access my newsletter page here\nListmonk feature overview These are all of the features that listmonk offers:\nTemplates Listmonk offers amazing built in template support.\nAll templates are written in HTML.\nYou can access the templates by going to Campaigns \u0026gt; Templates.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to always include {{ template \u0026quot;content\u0026quot; . }} (for the main content) and also an unsubscribe button in all of your templates\nCampaigns You can create a new campaign (email) by going to Campaigns \u0026gt; All Campaigns\nHere you can select a campaign name, subject the list\u0026rsquo;s you want to target and the template\nEmail lists You can create new lists by going to Lists \u0026gt; All Lists.\nFor example I have two lists:\nNew posts - Receive an email every time I post something new on my blog Weekly Roundup - Join my weekly roundup, where I share what I’ve been up to that week, including articles I’ve published, cool finds, tips and tricks and more! Not everyone wants to receive an email every time I post a new article, so I created two lists!\nHTML Forms Listmonk also offers embeddable html forms, to subscribe to the email list. You can access the form builder by going to Lists \u0026gt; Forms\nPublic subscription page Except for the HTML forms listmonk also has a public subscription page. For example here is mine.\nIt can also be accessed under `Lists \u0026gt; Forms\nCampaign analytics You can track the views, clicks and bounces of your email campaigns by going to Campaigns \u0026gt; Analytics.\nImport subscribers You can import subscribers from other platforms by going to Subscribers \u0026gt; Import.

But first\nWhat is gitea? Gitea is a painless selfhosted Git service. It is written in Go and is extremely lightweight. I run a gitea instance on my Le Potato and it barely uses any resources.\nWhy use gitea (vs GitHub, GitLab etc) I started running my own Gitea instance because I wanted a private place to host my Obsidian notes. I did not want to have them in a private GitHub repository since it\u0026rsquo;s not on my own hardware. GitLab is harder to spin up and has a lot of features that I do not need.\nIf you want an easy to spin up, private git service gitea is your way to go.\nSetup In this guide I will be using debian 12. The setup should be the same on any other distribution since we will be using docker.\nInstalling and setting up docker The first thing you will need is docker installed on your system.\nInstall docker on debian\nAlso make sure to add your user to the docker group. This will allow you to run docker commands without sudo.\nusermod -aG docker $USER Now reboot\nDocker-compose.yml Once docker is installed. We have to get gitea up and running\nFirst create a new directory. This will host our docker-compose file.\nmkdir gitea\nThen create/edit docker-compose.yml in your favourite text editor.\nvim docker-compose.yml\nThen paste the following content:\nversion: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; networks: gitea: external: false services: server: image: gitea/gitea:latest container_name: gitea environment: - USER_UID=1000 - USER_GID=1000 restart: always networks: - gitea volumes: - ./gitea:/data - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro ports: - \u0026#34;3000:3000\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;222:22\u0026#34; You can change any of the default ports eg switching 3000 to 8000 can be done like this:\nports: - \u0026#34;8080:3000\u0026#34; You can setup gitea using a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. But at least for my needs a simple SQLite3 database is more than enough.\nSince I want my repositories to still exist even if the container is deleted I will use named volumes. The configuration file with named volumes should look something like this:\nversion: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; networks: gitea: external: false volumes: gitea: driver: local services: server: image: gitea/gitea:latest container_name: gitea restart: always networks: - gitea volumes: - gitea:/data - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro ports: - \u0026#34;3000:3000\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;222:22\u0026#34; Starting the container and additional configuration Now you can start the container by typing:\ndocker compose up -d The -d flag will run it in detach mode. If you want to see the logs live you can remove it.\nAfter docker is done pulling, gitea should be up and running.\nNow open up:\nlocalhost:3000 or yourserverip:3000\nAnd you should see something like this:\nFill in all of the required information.

Basically I send out requests to a bunch of different exchanges and compare rates. This has to be made as fast as possible. In this post, I’ll some show some tweaks that I made in order to boost my performance significantly.\nHowever keep in mind that I am not an expert (especially in go) and I am just sharing my findings from my own personal project.\nImprovements These improvements come in order of biggest improvement of runtime.\n1. Using goroutines In any Go program, goroutines are essential for speed. The biggest boost I made was by sending requests concurrently. Since I need to hit up 12 different exchanges, sending these requests at the same time dropped my runtime from around 24 seconds to just ~3.\nGoroutines are amazing and extremely easy to use. You should include them wherever possible. But always be careful of Data Races\n2. Upgrading the JSON Library I swapped out encoding/json for github.com/json-iterator/go. jsoniter is a fast JSON processing library that works as a drop-in replacement for the standard library, so I didn’t have to change any code, just a library switch.\nBenchmark Results\nTo measure the performance improvements, I ran some benchmarks comparing encoding/json and jsoniter. Here’s a summary of the results:\ngoos: linux goarch: amd64 pkg: apiSpeedImprove cpu: AMD Ryzen 5 7640U w/ Radeon 760M Graphics BenchmarkEncodingJSON-12 140383 7381 ns/op BenchmarkJSONIter-12 974605 1217 ns/op PASS ok apiSpeedImprove 3.216s So, jsoniter is about 6 times faster than the standard library.\n3. Reusing HTTP Handlers I started reusing HTTP handlers instead of creating new ones for each request. By setting up a handler once and reusing it, I cut down on the overhead of making new handlers for each request.\nBenchmark Results\nHere are the results of the benchmarks comparing reused handlers versus creating new handlers for each request:\ngoos: linux goarch: amd64 pkg: apiSpeedImprove/httpReuse cpu: AMD Ryzen 5 7640U w/ Radeon 760M Graphics BenchmarkNewHttpClientEachRequest-12 3360 300058 ns/op BenchmarkReuseHttpClient-12 6470 175472 ns/op PASS ok apiSpeedImprove/httpReuse 4.010s Reusing HTTP handlers gave a solid performance boost compared to making a new handler for each request.\nConclusion With these tweaks I managed to cut the time it took to gather all the info from 24 seconds initially to about 2 seconds. Pretty solid improvement!\nIf you are interested the code for my benchmarks, it is available here\nIf you enjoyed this post and want to support my work, you can donate here.\nSubscribe Weekly Roundup Where I share what I’ve been up to that week, including articles I’ve published, cool finds, tips and tricks, and more!

But it\u0026rsquo;s not just a markdown editor. It\u0026rsquo;s a way to manage knowledge. It\u0026rsquo;s great for organizing your thoughts in a flexible, non-linear way.\nObsidian works on all platforms. So you can write articles from basically any platform.\nI have been taking all of my notes in it for a couple of months now and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing!\nHugo Hugo is an ultra fast static website generator made in golang. I have been using hugo for my blog for almost 2 years now. I recently switched the theme of my my blog. Read more about the change New Look, new start.\nUsing Obsidian with Hugo In this guide, I’ll show you how to get Obsidian and Hugo working together. I won’t cover the initial setup of either tool, but I’ll explain how to integrate them for a smooth blogging workflow.\nIf you need help setting up Hugo, check out my guide: How I Setup This Blog for Free (Domain, Hosting, SSL) Complete Guide. And if you’re new to Obsidian, check out this Getting Started Guide .\nGoals for Using Hugo with Obsidian My goals for the setup are:\nUsing a single obsidian vault Have an easy to use obsidian template that I can use for my blog posts. Keep my personal vault folders private. Auto publish using obsidian hotkeys. Have all markdown files in a public github repository, so that people can propose changes Existing setup Here’s how my current workflow with Obsidian and Hugo looks:\nI write and edit articles directly in Obsidian, within the content folder of my Hugo project. I run the Hugo command to generate the static site. I push the changes to GitHub. Render.com automatically picks up the changes and deploys the updated site. Journey If you want to skip the journey part you can go straight to The Sauce\nI will be going through a couple of mistakes that I made while setting this up.\nMistake #1 The first idea that I had was to create a simple symlink (I use linux btw) that would link the two folders together.\nBasically I have two folders:\nblog/ vault/ The blog folder contains all the blog folders and the vault is my personal vault.\nThe symlink would link these folders\nblog/content vault/Blog However the problem with a symlink is that the folder content is not visible in my git repo. This means that people can not propose changes to any of my articles\nMistake #2 I wanted to have my folders synced. I tried writing a couple of bash scripts that automatically synced the two folders using a cronjob. However having that constantly running the background is a waste of resources when I am not writing. Simply running the scripts via cli is just not that smooth.\nThe Sauce Basically the way that I have set this up is I have two folders:\nblog vault The blog folder contains all the necessary hugo files and also has a sub directory called content that houses all of the markdown blog files.\nI created a new folder inside of my vault called Blog\nblog/content vault/Blog After that I copied over all of my files from the content directory to the Blog.\nI then started writing this very article\nObsidian templates I needed some way to setup a simple obsidian template to contains all of the required hugo front matter.\nThat is quite easy.\nRead about how to setup templates Templates - obsidian.md\nI created a file called Blog Post in my templates folder\nMy Blog Post template contains the following:\n--- title: \u0026#34;{{Title}}\u0026#34; description: date: \u0026#34;{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}T{{time:HH:mm:ss}}+00:00\u0026#34; draft: true --- **If you enjoyed this article consider [supporting me](https://4rkal.com/donate)** I have all the required front matter including a title, description and a date in the format that hugo asks.\nI also added a small donation text that I include at the bottom of every article.\nThis means that I can automatically insert this template into any file and start writing!\nFolder Syncing Now I want all of my files in my vault/Blog directory to be copied over to the blog/content. Essentially connecting Hugo and Obsidian.\nThank\u0026rsquo;s to a helpful discord user I found the obsidian-shellcommands plugin.\nNOTE: this plugin does not currently work very well with the flatpak version of obsidian (since flatpak isolates the environment) . Using another alternative (.deb or appimage) seems to work.\nIt allows you to run shell commands in the background with a hotkey.\nThe steps to set this up are the following:\nInstall the plugin Enable the plugin Go to the plugin options Click on New shell command Now you will need to enter a shell command to copy the files from the one folder to the other. On Linux/MacOS that is:\ncp -a ~/folder1/. ~/folder2/\nin my case that is cp -a ~/Documents/vault/Blog/. ~/Documents/blog/content/\nOn windows it most probably is:\nrobocopy \u0026quot;%USERPROFILE%\\folder1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;%USERPROFILE%\\folder2\u0026quot; /E /COPYALL\nAfter that we need to set a hotkey that will run the command\nClick on the (+) icon to go to the hotkey settings and assign a hotkey\nMy hotkey is CTR + 0, simply because that was available.\nNow every time that I run the hotkey it copies over all of my files to the hugo folder ready to be published\nAuto publishing scripts I also want to be able to automatically publish my articles. But I want it to happen when hitting a hotkey.\nI wrote a small script that does exactly that:\n#!/bin/bash cd ~/Documents/blog hugo git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;new\u0026#34; git push -u origin main This script will build my website, commit and push to my github repo, where it is picked up and published. Read How I setup this blog for free (domain, hosting, ssl) Complete Guide to learn how to setup your own blog for free.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to make the script executable by running\nchmod +x ./YOURSCRIPT.sh\nThen create a new shell command for the shellcommand plugin (as we did before) and enter the path to your script.\nIn my case that is:\n~/Documents/blog/push.sh\nThen enter a hotkey and you\u0026rsquo;re done!\nConclusion I can now simply open my obsidian vault, create a new file, insert my template and have all the info automatically entered.\nI then write my article inside of obsidian\nRun my hotkey and copy all the files into the hugo directory\nHit another key and my blog is published!\nIf you enjoyed this article consider supporting me\nSubscribe Weekly Roundup Where I share what I’ve been up to that week, including articles I’ve published, cool finds, tips and tricks, and more!

I will not be providing any pre-built images.\nThe first thing you will have to do is install archuseriso. You can install it from the aur using this command:\nyay -S archuseriso\nNow open a terminal and navigate to any directory. Then run the following command:\nsudo aui-mkiso -m 'img' --add-pkg=monero-gui xfce --verbose\nThis will build a new gpt image with persistense, add the monero-gui package and use xfce as the default desktop.

I will be using the LoveIt theme but you can use any other theme\nAll hugo themes https://themes.gohugo.io/\nNOTE: I now use a completely different theme New look, new start\nFor the LoveIt theme:\nThe first thing we will have to do is type\ngit clone https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt.git themes/LoveIt\nYou will have to have git installed if you don’t, follow the instructions on the page to download it.\nNow we will have to create some basic configuration. Every theme has its own so you should first check your themes documentation. Some basic settings work for all themes.\nHere is an example of the most basic settings for the LoveIt theme. (it has to be saved in config.toml)\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;http://example.org/\u0026#34; # Change the default theme to be use when building the site with Hugo theme = \u0026#34;LoveIt\u0026#34; # website title title = \u0026#34;My New Hugo Site\u0026#34; # language code [\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;zh-CN\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pl\u0026#34;, ...] languageCode = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; # language name [\u0026#34;English\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;简体中文\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Français\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Polski\u0026#34;, ...] languageName = \u0026#34;English\u0026#34; # Author config [author] name = \u0026#34;xxxx\u0026#34; email = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; link = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Menu config [menu] [[menu.main]] weight = 1 identifier = \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; # you can add extra information before the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # you can add extra information after the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons post = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;Posts\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/posts/\u0026#34; # title will be shown when you hover on this menu link title = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; [[menu.main]] weight = 2 identifier = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; post = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/tags/\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; [[menu.main]] weight = 3 identifier = \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; post = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;Categories\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/categories/\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Markup related configuration in Hugo [markup] # Syntax Highlighting (https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting) [markup.highlight] # false is a necessary configuration (https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt/issues/158) noClasses = false You can find my configuration here\nYou can view your page live by running\nhugo serve\nLet’s move on to the next step.\nAdding articles to our blog The first thing we will have to do is create a new file with any name ending in .md inside of our content folder. I like to separate my posts from other sections so I will create another folder inside of the content one called posts.\nYou can run this command to add the file\nhugo new posts/first_post.md\nNow open the file that was just created using your favorite text editor.\nYou should see something like this:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Epic title\u0026#34; date: 2023-03-23T18:13:03+03:00 draft: true --- If you want the post to be publicly visible on your blog delete the draft line. or set it to false.\nNow if we want to add some content we will have to write it in markdown. Heres a great guide on some basic markdown syntax https://hugoloveit.com/basic-markdown-syntax/\nHeres an example of some content\n--- title: \u0026#34;My First Post\u0026#34; date: 2023-03-23T18:13:03+03:00 draft: false --- # Welcome to my blog! This is my first post. Here\u0026#39;s a picture of my cat: ![My cat](/images/cat.jpg) Using the above steps you can add all of your articles to the blog.\nNow that we are done with that let me show you how we will publish our blog.\nDomain More like a sub-domain. Head to eu.org and get a free domain. Create an account and submit a request for a new domain. It might take some time even months to get accepted.\nI have already registered 4rkal.eu.org from there.\nNow we will have to get some ssl certificates using cloudflare.\nSSL certificates just make your site use https instead of http this is really great for seo and doesn’t make your site look sus.\nHead over to cloudflare.com and create an account for free.\nAfter you are done with that go to your dashboard and select websites and then add a site.\nYou should see something like this\nEnter your websites url and click on add site.\nAfter that select the free plan and continue.\nNow it will review your dns records. Just select continue and confirm\nNow you will have to change your domain’s name servers.\nTo do that head back to eu.org select your domain and click on the nameservers tab and select server names.\nNow in the input fields enter the name servers.\nThe name servers will most probably be:\nnancy.ns.cloudflare.com uriah.ns.cloudflare.com Here’s how it should probably look:\nNow click on the submit button.\nYou should probably get\nNo error, applying changes... Done If you get an error you probably screwed up one of the above steps. Just try again.\nAfter your name servers have been changed and everything is done, in your domain dashboard select SSL/TLS. Just select full encryption.\nHosting our site. First create a github account. Head to github.com for that. You will also have to install git\nAfter you have done that navigate to your blog’s root directory and type:\ngit init hugo git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;first commmit\u0026#34; git branch -M main Now go to github and create a new repository.\nYou should now type:\ngit remote add origin YOURURL\ninstead of YOURURL enter the url to your github repo and add a .git ending\neg\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/4rkal/blog.git\nNow push the changes with\ngit push -u origin main\nAfter that if you refresh the page of your github repo you should see everything there.\nNow head to render.com and create an account\nOn your dashboard select +New and then static site.\nNow you will be prompted to connect a github repository. Just connect your account and add that repository.\neg\nNow enter a service name eg myblog and in the publish directory just add\npublic\nThen click on create static site.\nAfter it has been deployed successfully head over to the settings and in the custom domains tab click on add custom domain.\nIn the field enter the domain that we registered with eu.org previously.\nNow go to cloudflare and in your domain dashboard select dns and click on add a new record.\nIn the type dropdown select CNAME in the name field add @ and in the target add your blog’s url from render. Mine is https://blog-ygtj.onrender.com/. Also untick the proxy status.\nNow we will have to do the same but with the www.\nJust do the same steps as above but instead of @ just add www\nThat’s it. After a couple of minutes your blog should be live.\nSEO Google and bing If you want to get your website on google and bing it’s pretty easy\nIf you want to get your website on google follow the guide listed here https://developers.google.com/search\nFor bing it should be pretty much the same process on https://www.bing.com/webmasters/\n*If you enjoyed this article consider supporting me\n","permalink":"https://4rkal.com/posts/thisblog/","summary":"In this article I’ll show you how I setup this blog completely for free.

Going over the basics of Python.\nIn this course/article I will be talking about why someone should use Python. Later on, I will be tackling the basics of Python. But let\u0026rsquo;s start by explaining what coding is.\nWhat is coding? Coding means writing instructions for computers and a finished set of instructions is known as a program. Computer programs control everything from smartphones to space rockets.\nWhat is Python? Python is a text-based computer language which means it’s made up of words and symbols (such as * and = ). Its language elements and object-oriented approach are meant to assist programmers in writing clear, logical code for both small and large-scale projects.\nWhy Python? Python is one of the most popular computer languages and it’s very concise — that is, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to type much in order to create programs that do a lot.\nAdvantages of python Simple to read, learn, and write Python is a high-level programming language with a syntax that is similar to English. This makes the code easier to read and comprehend.\nPython is really simple to pick up and understand, which is why many people suggest it to newcomers. When compared to other prominent languages like C/C++ and Java, you require fewer lines of code to accomplish the same purpose.\nImproved Productivity Python is an extremely useful programming language. Python’s simplicity allows developers to concentrate on solving the problem.\nThey don’t need to spend a lot of time learning the programming language’s syntax or behaviour. You write less code and accomplish more.\nFree and Open-Source Python comes under the OSI-approved open-source license. As a result, it is both free to use and distribute. You can get the source code, change it, and even share your own Python version.\nPortability In many languages like C/C++, you need to change your code to run the program on different platforms. With Python, however, this is not the case. You only have to write it once and it may be used wherever.\nDownloading Python On Linux You probably already know how to install it but I\u0026rsquo;m gonna show it anyways.\nOpen your terminal and type python or python3; if it does not work then run: (depending on your distro) sudo apt install python3\nWindows 10 1 . First check if you already have Python installed. Go to the ‘Start’ menu and click on the ‘All programs’. If you see the word “Python” it means that you already have it installed. If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have it installed go to https://python.org, download the correct version for your computer and then install it.\nPython comes in different versions. This course uses version 3 and upwards. I recommend always installing the latest version. What is an IDE? IDE stands for the integrated development environment (IDE) and is software for building applications that combine common developer tools into a single Graphical User Interface (GUI).\nThe IDE that we will be using in this series is called VS Code.\nDownloading VS Code Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download the version that you want. Vs Code is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Follow the instructions on the website for installation.\nStarting in Python It\u0026rsquo;s traditional in the programming world to make the computer say ‘Hello World’ with your very first piece of code. In Python, this is very simple.\nOpen Vs Code and click on File \u0026gt; New File and name your file helloworld.py. The .py tells the computer that this is a Python program. In your project, in VS Code type : print(\u0026quot;Hello World!\u0026quot;) Save your project and click on the run button at the top of your screen If you have done everything correctly you should see a Hello World message in your terminal. If it didn\u0026rsquo;t work you should get a red error message something like this:\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\nIf that happens make sure that you have copied it exactly like above.\nPlaying With numbers in Python Python makes it easy to do maths. You just type in a question and get the answer\nAdding Up\nOpen an empty project and type:\nprint(2+2)\nYou should see the answer: 4\nSubtracting(and more) If you want to subtract, use the ‘-’ symbol like this:\nprint(2 - 2)\nTo multiply use the ‘*’ symbol:\nprint(2 * 2)\nTo divide, use the ‘/’ symbol\nprint(2 / 2)\nVariables A variable is like a labelled box that stores information. You can change this information but the label stays the same.\nCreating a variable: To tell the computer what you want your variable to be, you use the = sign. This is called assigning a value to a variable. It’s very simple, here\u0026rsquo;s an example using fish.\nOpen a new VS Code project and type: fish = 5 Imagine a cat gets hungry and eats two fish. To create another variable for the amount eaten, write the following:\nfishEaten = 2\nPress enter and then type:\nprint(fish - fishEaten)\nSave and run your code and you should get the answer: 3\nInput in Python You can use the input() function to ask for information from the user.\nOpen a new VS Code project and type: name = input(\u0026quot;What is your name? \u0026quot;)\nRun the program and you should get the following message: What is your name? 3. Now let\u0026rsquo;s try printing your name.\nAdd the following to your program:\nprint(name)\nYou have successfully created an input field!\nThis can be very useful in creating decision games.\nMaking Decisions To write a program that allows you to make decisions the computer needs to react differently to different answers. For this, you need conditions to compare pieces of information, and conditionals to create different paths through the program.\nWhat are Conditions? A condition is a bit of code that compares two pieces of information. Conditions use operators to make these comparisons. For example, the operator == checks if two pieces of information are the same.\nOpen a new Vs Code project and type: age = 10 if age == 12: print(\u0026#34;True\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;False\u0026#34;) Save and run and you should get False That is because ‘age’ is set to 10 and not 12\nWhat are conditionals To use a condition in your code you need a command called a condition. Conditionals use conditions. Conditions show if something is True or False.\nIF One important condition is known as an if statement which tests whether a condition is true. If it is, the computer will follow the instructions after the if statement. If not, the computer will just skip it. In Python, if is a keyword. Dont use it as a variable name because the computer will think that it\u0026rsquo;s an if statement and get confused.\nImplementing the if condition Create a new VS Code project and type the following: user_reply = (\u0026quot;Do you like python? (Type yes or no) \u0026quot;)\nThen we will implement the if condition by typing the following: if user_reply == \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; print(\u0026#34;Python likes you to ! \u0026#34;) ELIF elif is short for else if. If the conditions of the if code isn’t met it “sweeps up” whatever is left.\nNow type the following: elif user_reply == \u0026#34;maybe\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Make up your mind!\u0026#34;) ELSE When conditions for the if and elif code arent met, else goes into action and “sweeps up” whatever is left.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s implement that: 4. Now type the following:\nelse: print(\u0026#34;Well python doesn\u0026#39;t like you either\u0026#34;) The complete code should look something like this:\nuser_reply = (\u0026#34;Do you like python? (Type yes or no) \u0026#34;) if user_reply == \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; print(\u0026#34;Python likes you to ! \u0026#34;) elif user_reply == \u0026#34;maybe\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Make up your mind!\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;Well python doesn\u0026#39;t like you either\u0026#34;) Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to press the tab after if statements.\nRandomness in python In python we can use the random function in order to generate random numbers. This can be extremely useful in a variety of things.\nThe first thing we will have to do is import the random function\nimport random\nAfter that we can print out a random number with the following\nprint(random.randint(1,10))\nThis will output a random number from 1–10\nrandint stands for random integer.\nHere is the full code.\nimport random print(random.randint(1,10)) Loops in python There are two types of loops in python\nWhile loop For loop While loops only stop when something changes. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t change they could go on forever.\nWith for loops on the other hand you can define exactly when you want them to stop\nThe most popular example of a while loop is\nwhile True:\nWhich will run forever eg\nwhile True: print(\u0026#34;hi\u0026#34;) This will run forever.\nWith while loops on the other hand you can define exactly how many times you want the loop to run.\nfor x in range(0,10): print(\u0026#34;Hi\u0026#34;) This will print Hi exactly 10 times\nGuessing game Now lets combine what learned from above and from our previous articles to create a game\nThe computer will select a random number from 1–10 and you will have to guess it.\nThe first thing we will have to do is\nimport random\nAfter that we will create a variable called number\nnumber = random.randint(1,10)\nAfter that we will create another variable called your_guess\nyour_guess = int(input(\u0026quot;Im thinking of a number from 1 to 10, can you guess which one?\u0026quot;))\nWe are using int as you will have to enter a number\nNow we will create a while loop that will keep the game running until you guess the number\nwhile your_guess != number:\nThe code so far is\nimport random number = random.randint(1,10) your_guess = int(input(\u0026#34;Im thinking of a number from 1 to 10, can you guess which one?\u0026#34;)) while your_guess != number: if your_guess \u0026lt; number: print(\u0026#34;Your number was too low\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;You number was to high\u0026#34;) And the following\nprint(\u0026quot;GG you found it\u0026quot;)\nYou code should now look like this\nimport random number = random.randint(1,10) your_guess = int(input(\u0026#34;Im thinking of a number from 1 to 10, can you guess which one?\u0026#34;)) while your_guess != number: if your_guess \u0026lt; number: print(\u0026#34;Your number was too low\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;You number was to high\u0026#34;) your_guess = int(input(\u0026#34;Please try again... \u0026#34;)) print(\u0026#34;GG you found it\u0026#34;) Thats it for now\nStay tuned for more\nIf you enjoyed this article consider supporting me\n","permalink":"https://4rkal.com/posts/python/","summary":"Why you should use Python.

Monero is a decentralized cryptocurrency. It uses a public distributed ledger with privacy-enhancing technologies that obfuscate transactions to achieve anonymity and fungibility. Observers cannot decipher addresses trading Monero, transaction amounts, address balances, or transaction histories.\nMonero works like any other currency but with some privacy and decentralization innovations.\nMonero uses stealth addresses alongside ring signatures and ring CTs to \u0026ldquo;hide\u0026rdquo; the transaction and transaction amounts, enhancing transaction privacy. To further decentralize the network, Monero uses the RandomX algorithm to discourage the use of ASICs.\nThe Main Problems with Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Bitcoin may seem like a perfect currency. However, under the hood, Bitcoin has many flaws.\nOne of the main problems with Bitcoin is that it isn\u0026rsquo;t actually censorship-resistant. A central bank or government can blacklist your address and block exchanges from accepting it. While there are ways to get around that, it isn\u0026rsquo;t easy. Monero, on the other hand, is censorship-resistant as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t display transaction amounts or receivers.\nAnother problem with Bitcoin and other PoW currencies is that they are actually controlled by a small number of people since they are really hard to mine, among many other factors. Monero is a relatively easy currency to mine and is ASIC-resistant, which makes it even more decentralized as anyone with a computer and an internet connection can start contributing to the network.\nBitcoin has a block size limit, which results in more expensive transactions and longer waiting times. Monero uses a dynamic block size.\nAlso, Bitcoin has a high block time, which means that transactions take longer to be confirmed and executed. Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s block time is ~10 minutes, while Monero\u0026rsquo;s block time is ~2 minutes.\nBitcoin has halving once every 4 years. The halving halves the amount of mined (printed) Bitcoin in every block. This, by itself, increases price volatility and transaction fee volatility.\nMonero has chosen a 0.6 XMR block reward forever. Any good currency wants to have as little volatility as possible. Monero is a currency, not a \u0026ldquo;number go up coin.\u0026rdquo;\nConclusion Monero is basically what people think Bitcoin is.

Nmap sends packets and examines the answers to find hosts and services on a computer network. For probing computer networks, Nmap offers a variety of functionalities, including host discovery, service detection, and operating system detection. Scripts that offer more sophisticated service discovery, vulnerability detection, and other features can extend these features. During a scan, Nmap can adjust to changing network conditions, such as latency and congestion.\nInstallation Nmap is available for linux, windows , mac os and even bsd\nIf you are using linux you can install it using your package manager.\nOn apt\nsudo apt install nmap\nOn dnf\nsudo dnf install nmap\nWith pacman\nsudo pacman -S nmap\nOn windows you have to download the executable from the nmap website.\nhttps://nmap.org/download.html\nThe same goes for mac and any other os\nGetting Started The first thing I will show you how to do is find all the ip addresses connected to your local network.\nThe first thing you will have to do is find your inet ip\nOn Linux type\nip a\nOn windows\nipconfig\nYou should see a lot of information, try to find inet.

After Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub there have been many controversies like blocking private repositories and access to GitHub pages in certain countries and of course, GitHub Copilot.\nWhat is Github Copilot GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI to assist users of Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs) by autocompleting code. Currently available by subscription to individual developers, the tool was first announced by GitHub on 29 June 2021, and works best for users coding in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go.\nHow does copilot work? GitHub Copilot is powered by the OpenAI Codex, an artificial intelligence model created by OpenAI. The Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) language model, which uses deep learning to create text that resembles human speech, is improved and used in production as the OpenAI Codex.\nGithub copilot was trained on a selection of the English language, public GitHub repositories, including 59 gigabytes of Python code sourced from 54 million public GitHub repositories.\nThere still is a lot of controversy about whether GitHub should be allowed to do so, as most open source licences obviously don’t contain anything against analyzing your code with AI and selling it. Also, as AI is analyzing the code base it is not classified as derivative work which seems to be legal. However, it seems quite unethical by Microsoft as Copilot is a paid service that relies on analyzing other people’s code. Read more: https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22561180/github-copilot-legal-copyright-fair-use-public-code\nIf copilot was free to use it would make a lot more sense as it utilizes FOSS(Free and open sourced software) in order to work. However with Microsoft’s decision to make copilot payed they are monetizing most off GitHub\u0026rsquo;s code base which is an illegal grey zone.\nAnalyzing a huge amount of code without any security features has led to many problems like GitHub leaking phone numbers (I even encountered it while testing copilot out).\nhttps://github.com/community/community/discussions/9584?sort=top?sort=top\nLast but not least by using GitHub copilot you agree to the ToS which clearly states\nGitHub Copilot gives you certain choices about how it uses the data it collects. User engagement data, including pseudonymous identifiers and general usage data, is required for the use of GitHub Copilot and will continue to be collected, processed, and shared with Microsoft and OpenAI as you use GitHub Copilot. You can choose whether your code snippets are collected and retained by GitHub and further processed and shared with Microsoft and OpenAI by adjusting your user settings. Conclusion I personally don’t use or will ever use GitHub Copilot or recommend it to anyone for the following reasons:\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t help you learn. Instead does the opposite. Recommends other peoples’ phone numbers, emails and even aws keys. No features have been implemented to stop this as far as I know. Tracks your usage and collects a lot of data. Like Source code that you are editing, related files and other files open in the same IDE or editor, URLs of repositories and files paths. Is paid and proprietary. (You pay to be tracked) Monetizes Open Source Software in an unethical way. Github CoPilot generates vulnerable code 40% of the time PS if you don’t want GitHub to legally index your code, you could try one of these licenses They might work\n***If you enjoyed this article consider supporting me\nSubscribe Weekly Roundup Where I share what I’ve been up to that week, including articles I’ve published, cool finds, tips and tricks, and more!

There are plenty of perks to doing so instead of relying on platforms like GitHub. For starters, you\u0026rsquo;ll have complete control over your code, ensuring it can’t be used for profit or deleted by anyone but you.\nWhat You’ll Need A Computer for Your Server: Ideally running Linux (Debian is a solid choice). Internet Connection: Pretty essential for accessing your server remotely. Another Computer with Git Installed: This is what you\u0026rsquo;ll use to interact with your server. Step-by-Step Setup Guide 1. Install Git on Your Server First, you need to install Git on your server. Depending on your Linux distribution, use one of these commands:\nFor Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu): sudo apt install git For Fedora-based systems: sudo dnf install git For Arch-based systems: sudo pacman -S git 2. Create a Git User Next, create a dedicated user for Git operations:\nsudo useradd git You\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to enter some information. Feel free to leave everything blank except for the password.\n3. Secure Your Server with SSH Keys Log in as the new Git user:\nsu git Then, enhance security by setting up SSH keys:\nmkdir .ssh chmod 700 .ssh/ touch .ssh/authorized_keys chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys 4. Generate and Add SSH Keys On your main machine (the one you’ll be committing from), generate an SSH key:\nssh-keygen Copy the SSH public key to your server:\nssh-copy-id git@your-server-ip To find your server\u0026rsquo;s IP, use:\nifconfig Now, you should be able to log in to your server without needing a password:\nssh git@your-server-ip 5. Set Up Your Git Repository Directory Create a directory to store your Git repositories. For example:\nmkdir ~/git Give ownership of this directory to the Git user:\nchown git:git ~/git 6. Create a New Repository For each project, create a separate directory:\nmkdir ~/git/my_cool_project.git Initialize the repository as a bare repository (suitable for sharing):\ncd ~/git/my_cool_project.git git init --bare 7. Test Your Setup To test your new Git server, try cloning the repository from another machine:\ngit clone git@your-server-ip:~/git/my_cool_project.git You might see:\nwarning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository. That’s because you haven’t added any files yet. Go ahead and add a file:\ntouch stuff.txt Commit your changes:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026#34;first commit\u0026#34; Now, try cloning again, and everything should work smoothly.\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully set up your own Git server! Now you have full control over your code and can collaborate without relying on third-party services.\nEnjoyed this guide?

The most basic is password authentication, which is simple to use but not particularly secure. The more advanced and secure way is via ssh keys.Brute-forcing a password-protected account is quite possible thanks to modern computing power and automated scripts. The solution to that is ssh key based authentication.\nHow does Key Based Authentication work? SSH key pairs are two cryptographically secure keys that allow a client to connect to an SSH server. A public key and a private key make up each key pair.The client keeps the private key, which should be kept completely confidential.\nIf the attacker has access to the private key, they will be able to enter into servers using the corresponding public key without requiring further authentication. A passphrase can be used to encrypt the key on disc as an extra precaution.\nThe related public key can be freely shared without causing any harm. The public key can be used to encrypt communications that can only be decrypted with the private key. This attribute is used to verify the authenticity of the key pair. The public key is placed on a distant server that you wish to use SSH to access. The key is saved in a special file called /.ssh/authorized keys in the user account you’ll be login into.\nWhen a client uses SSH keys to authenticate, the server can check if the client has the private key. A shell session is started or the requested command is executed if the client can verify ownership of the private key.\nSetting up The first thing we will have to to do is generate an SSH key pair on your local computer.\nTo do that type\nssh-keygen\nYou should see something like this\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/4rkal/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): If you want to you can enter a passphrase to encrypt the private key.\nAfter that your key should be generated.\nNow you will have to copy your public key to your server.\nTo do that type\nssh-copy-id username@host_ip\n(find your servers ip by typing ifconfig in your server)\neg.\n`ssh-copy-id server@192.168.1.13'\nTry to ssh into your server by typing\nssh username@host_ip\nYou should be able to login into your server without the password.

Tor — short for the Onion Routing project — is an open-source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing. The worldwide Tor computer network uses secure, encrypted protocols to ensure that users’ online privacy is protected. Tor users’ digital data and communications are shielded using a layered approach that resembles the nested layers of an onion.\nWhy use Tor? Tor is useful for anyone who wants to keep their internet activities out of the hands of advertisers, ISPs, and websites. That includes people getting around censorship restrictions in their country, people looking to hide their IP address, or anyone else who doesn’t want their browsing habits linked to them.\nThe Tor network may also host webpages that only other Tor users can view. In other words, you’ve entered the Dark Web, which consists of websites that aren’t indexed by the standard crawlers you use to look for products to purchase, and quiz answers etc . On the Dark Web, you can discover everything from free textbooks to drugs — and worse — as long as you know the secret URL that leads to these sites.\nTor Websites Just like any other website, you will need to know the address of an onion service in order to connect to it. An onion address is a string of 56 mostly random letters and numbers, followed by “.onion”.\nRequirements A linux machine (debian preferably) An internet connection (pretty hard without one,trust me) Installation The first thing we will have to do is install Tor\napt install tor\nNow we will have to enable tor hidden service(which is the website) for that type:\nsudo nano /etc/tor/torrc\nYou should see a large configuration file, search for HiddenService\nYou will have to uncoment:\n#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ #HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80 Now press cntrl s and then cntrl x to exit\nAfter that start the tor service by running\nsudo service tor start\nor\nsudo systemctl start tor\nNow we also have to install nginx to be able to run our website to do that type\nsudo apt install nginx\nStart the nginx service with the systemctl or service command\nNow we also have to install nginx to be able to run our website to do that type\nsudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname\nYou should see a address that looks something like this\ntiur7p652svsaemdewbsxnnkrj3b35ny2rx454od5wk5ivfqhijm2qd.onion\nNow open your tor browser and paste your address and press enter.\nYou will most probably be greeted by the default nginx site.\nThis page is easily customized, you can check out my article: here\nGG you did it you are now running a pretty anonymous website on the tor network.\n*If you enjoyed this article consider supporting me\n","permalink":"https://4rkal.com/posts/torhs/","summary":"In this article i will be showing you how to host your “dark web” aka Tor website for free.\nWhat is Tor? Tor — short for the Onion Routing project — is an open-source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing. The worldwide Tor computer network uses secure, encrypted protocols to ensure that users’ online privacy is protected. Tor users’ digital data and communications are shielded using a layered approach that resembles the nested layers of an onion.","title":"Setup a tor website (hidden service)"},{"content":"As the linuxfoundation states about 95% of cloud providers run kubernetes which is an open sourced solution, the Apache Web server powers millions of websites including netflix.com, spotify.com and more. Most of the Internets core functions are based on open source technology. But what is it and why is it so important?\nWhat is open sourced software? Open-source software is computer software that is distributed under a license that allows users to use, study, modify and distribute the program and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be created in a public, collaborative environment. Open-source software is a good example of open collaboration since it allows any skilled user to engage in development online.\n\u0026ldquo;Certainly there’s a phenomenon around open source. You know free software will be a vibrant area. There will be a lot of neat things that get done there.\u0026rdquo; -Bill Gates\nWhy open source? There are several advantages to using open-source software.\nTrust. One of the most important advantages is trust. As users can examine your code and make sure its not doing anything they don’t want it to. They are also able to change things they don’t like. Most cryptocurrency projects are open sourced to be able to develop trust with their community.\nCommunity A open source community allows more developers to build around the project . Bitcoin is the greatest example of such a community. As soon as bitcoin source code was published many utilities for bitcoin were made like wallets and more which would never have been made if bitcoin wasn’t open sourced.\nTransparency Anyone can read your source code and see if they want it to do what it is doing. That way your company gains a lot of trust.\n\u0026ldquo;Talk is cheap show me the code\u0026rdquo; Linus Torvalds\nContinuous evolution Your project will continue to be developed even if you give up on it. Again the greatest example for this kind of project is bitcoin. Even though the founder of bitcoin has vanished for more than 10 years, cryptocurrency technology is \u0026ldquo;changing\u0026rdquo; the world.\nLower Development costs (For companies) You can reduce your costs by using open source software. You can save money on licensing and maintenance. The only costs you’d have to deal with are those for documentation, media, support etc.\nControll With open source YOU are ultimately in controll.

But how does it work?\nSSH (secure shell) is a network protocol that allows two computers to connect securely over the internet. SSH uses encryption to prevent hackers from reading data sent between two connected devices.\nSSH is divided into three layers:\nThe transport layer The connection layer The authentication layer During and after authentication, the transport layer establishes safe and secure communication between a client and a server. It is in charge of data encryption, decryption, and integrity assurance. It also provides data compression and caching, which helps to speed up data communication.\nThe authentication layer informs the client about the available authentication methods. It’s also in charge of the whole user authentication procedure.\nAfter the authentication is successful, the connection layer oversees the communication between the machines. It manages communication channel opening and closure, as well as multiple channels for multiple sessions.\nSession Encryption The server sends the client a list of supported encryption protocols after receiving a connection request. The public key is used by the server as an authentication technique.\nThe client compares the protocols to the ones it already knows. If there are two protocols that are compatible, the machines agree to use one of them to establish the connection.\nOn the first connection attempt, the client compares the server’s public key to the private key saved in its system. If the keys are identical, the client and server agree to communicate using symmetric encryption during the SSH session. They communicate utilizing an asymmetrically encrypted mechanism based on the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange algorithm for this purpose. There are different ciphers that can be used for SSH depending on the applications being used. Some of them include:\nCHACHA20 AES-GCM Blowfish-CBC AES128-CTR AES192-CTR AES256-CTR Arcfour Cast128-CBC Different Encryption Techniques SSH uses a variety of data manipulation techniques at various points in the transaction to ensure the security of information transmission. These include symmetrical and asymmetrical encryption, as well as hashing.\nSymmetrical Encryption Symmetric encryption creates a single key that is exchanged between two machines. The key is then used by the machines for both encryption and decryption. This approach is rapid and resource-light, and it is used by SSH for each session. When the client and server are deciding which algorithm to employ for an SSH session, the first algorithm on the client’s list that the server supports is always used.\nAsymmetrical Encryption Any party can have access to the public key. Although it is linked to its paired key, the private key cannot be deduced from the public key. The public key and private key have a mathematical relationship that allows the public key to encrypt messages that can only be decrypted by the private key. This is a one-way ability, which means that the public key cannot decode the communications it sends or decrypt anything the private key sends it.\nThe private key should be kept completely confidential and never shared with anybody else. This is a necessary condition for the public key paradigm to function.The only component that can decrypt communications encrypted with the accompanying public key is the private key. Any entity capable of decrypting these messages has demonstrated control over the private key as a result of this fact.\nHashing r key defining characteristics are that they are never supposed to be reversed, that they are nearly hard to predictably alter, and that they are practically unique.\nIf you use the same hashing function and message, you should get the same hash; if you change any part of the data, you should get a completely different hash. A user should not be able to deduce the actual message from a hash, but they should be able to determine whether a message produced a hash.\nSession Encryption Negotiation The server sends the client a list of supported encryption protocols after receiving a connection request. The public key is used by the server as an authentication technique.\nThe client evaluates the protocols in comparison to its own. The machines choose one to create the connection using if there are any compatible protocols.\nOn the initial connection attempt, the client checks the server\u0026rsquo;s public key to the saved copy of its own private key. The client and server consent to using symmetric encryption to communicate during an SSH session if the keys match. They converse utilizing an asymmetric encryption method that makes use of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange algorithm.\nUsing a public network, machines can safely collaborate to build a cryptographic key thanks to the DH algorithm. The machines go through the following processes to create a key:\nThe machines agree on two numbers: a modulus and a base number. To prevent brute force key decryption, the chosen modulus is a prime number of at least 600 digits. In order to solve the equation involving the two public numbers, the machines independently select one number. The calculated values are exchanged between the server and the client. Now, utilizing the information obtained from the other machine, each machine computes something. By carrying out the above processes, both machines determine the identical value, which is their secret key. The server then makes an attempt to verify the user\u0026rsquo;s identity who made the access request.\n***If you enjoyed this article consider supporting me\n","permalink":"https://4rkal.com/posts/howsshworks/","summary":"If you work in the IT industry, you’ve undoubtedly heard of ssh.

This is an updated version of my previous article which unfortunately doesn\u0026rsquo;t work anymore. If you’re a complete beginner, read my python article to understand the basics. (https://4rkal.com/posts/python/)\nWhat is selenium? Selenium is an open source umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries aimed at supporting browser automation. You can use selenium in multiple programming languages including JavaScript (Node.js), C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala and with multiple web browsers including firefox, internet explorer, safary, opera, chrome and edge. Selenium can be very useful for web scraping, automating boring and manual tasks and so much more.\nSetup To install selenium you first have to install a browser driver. Here is the list of supported web browsers :\nFirefox Internet Explorer? Safari Opera Chrome Edge In this article we will be using firefox geckodriver. But you can use any of the browser drivers above. Downloading geckodriver To get started go to github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases Scroll down and select the package for your computer. I’ll use geckodriver-v0.31.0-linux64.tar.gz because I’m using a linux 64-bit computer.\nInstalling geckodriver The setup varies depending on your operating system.\nIf you are using Arch Linux: You can install geckodriver from the aur. Using your favourite aur helper\nOn linux:\nUnzip the file Make the file executable chmod +x geckodriver Add the driver to your PATH so other tools can find it: export PATH=$PATH:/path-to-extracted-file/ On windows: Unzip the file Paste the file in the directory that your script will run Installing selenium To install selenium you have to have python and pip installed.Check out my article on python for more To install selenium open your cmd or terminal and type:\npip install selenium That should install it.\\\nBasics of selenium The first thing we have to do is to create a new file with the .py ending eg. main.py\nAfter you have created it open it in your ide or editor of choice.\\\nThe first thing that we have to do is to import the selenium webdriver : from selenium import webdriver\nAfter that we have to specify what webdriver we are using. In our case its firefox browser = webdriver.Firefox()\nNow we need to specify the url that we want it to go to eg python.org\nbrowser.get(\u0026#39;https://python.org\u0026#39;) The full code so far is:\\ import selenium from selenium import webdriver browser = webdriver.Firefox() browser.get(\u0026#39;https://python.org\u0026#39;) Now we might want it to click on the Downloads button\nThere are a few ways to do this\nMethod 1 of clicking a button The first is with XPATH\nTo find the xpath of a button / object on a website you have to open your web browser go to the desired website and hit F12 to get the development tools. Now you should click on the select tool (See below) Click on it and after that hover above the downloads button with your mouse and click it. After that you should see a bit of code getting highlighted. Right click on the bit of code and select Copy then select Xpath Now go back to the python file and type:\ndriver.find_element(By.XPATH, 'XPATH_HERE')\nThis will throw an error, to fix that error simply add this at the top of the file\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nYour code so far should look like this\nimport selenium from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By browser = webdriver.Firefox() browser.get(\u0026#39;https://python.org\u0026#39;) browser.find_element(By.XPATH, \u0026#39;/html/body/div/header/div/nav/ul/li[2]/a\u0026#39;).click() Method 2 XPATH with text The second method is a bit simpler but not as reliable as the first as there might be many objects with the same name.\nTo use this method type: browser.find_element(By.XPATH, \u0026quot;//*[contains(text(), 'Downloads')]\u0026quot;).click() Your code should look something like this\nimport selenium from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By browser = webdriver.Firefox() browser.get(\u0026#39;https://python.org\u0026#39;) browser.find_element(By.XPATH, \u0026#34;//*[contains(text(), \u0026#39;Downloads\u0026#39;)]\u0026#34;).click() . . . . .\nThere many methods on how to locate elements but the above i believe are the easiest. The methods are the following\nBy.ID By.NAME By.XPATH By.LINK-TEXT By.TAG_NAME By.CLASS_NAME By.CSS_SELECTOR\\ Read more here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html\nTyping text into input fields. Typing text into input fields is pretty straight forward.\nFor that we will use any of the above methods. I\u0026rsquo;m going to use xpath.\nFind the xpath of any input field, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the google.com search field\nCopy the xpath and type:\na = browser.find_element(By.XPATH, \u0026quot;XPATH_HERE\u0026quot;) Paste the xpath in XPATH_HERE\nTo send keys we need to import the selenium.webdriver.common.keys library for that paste this line of code at the top of your file\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\nNow type:\na.send_keys(\u0026quot;python\u0026quot;)\nAfter that we want to press the enter key for that type:\na.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)\nThe full code should look something like this:\nimport selenium from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys browser = webdriver.Firefox() browser.get(\u0026#39;https://google.com\u0026#39;) a = browser.find_element(By.XPATH, \u0026#34;/html/body/div[1]/div[3]/form/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[2]/input\u0026#34;) a.send_keys(\u0026#34;python\u0026#34;) a.send_keys(Keys.RETURN) GG you just automated your first google search!
