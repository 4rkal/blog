      <description>In this article I will show you how I securely connect to my remote machines without having to configure port forwarding.
Requirements: A computer &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; (running linux) A internet connection Another computer to connect to your server (running linux) Why? If you want to access your server without portforwarding in a extremely secure fashion you will want to follow this tutorial. You will be connecting to the server via tor which will make it harder for anyone to find the url of the server and ill show you how to setup keybased auth for even more security!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article I will show you how I securely connect to my remote machines without having to configure port forwarding.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements:</h2>
<ol>
<li>A computer &ldquo;server&rdquo; (running linux)</li>
<li>A internet connection</li>
<li>Another computer to connect to your server (running linux)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>If you want to access your server without portforwarding in a extremely secure fashion you will want to follow this tutorial. You will be connecting to the server via tor which will make it harder for anyone to find the url of the server and ill show you how to setup keybased auth for even more security!</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>You will have to install the following packages (ssh, tor)</p>
<p>On debian</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install openssh-client</code></p>
<p>On arch</p>
<p><code>sudo pacman -S openssh</code></p>
<p>After that enable the ssh service</p>
<p>Debian:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl enable ssh</code></p>
<p>Arch:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl enable sshd</code></p>
<p>If you want to check if this worked just use another computer and run</p>
<p><code>ssh USER@IP</code></p>
<p>for example I run</p>
<p><code>ssh arkal@192.168.1.69</code></p>
<p>After this you can enable KeyBased authentication for more security</p>
<p>Here is my article how to enable that :</p>
<p><a href="https://4rkal.eu.org/posts/sssh/">Enable keybased authentication</a></p>
<p>After you have done that you want to edit your torrc file. Using your favorite text editor</p>
<p><code>sudo vim /etc/tor/torrc</code></p>
<p>Now you will want to navigate to the part that says HiddenService. And paste the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
</code></pre><p>Save your file and exit the editor (for nano cntrl s, cntrl x)</p>
<p>Now you want will have to restart the tor service</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl restart tor</code></p>
<p>After that run the following:</p>
<p><code>sudo cat /var/lib/tor/ssh/hostname</code></p>
<p>You should see a string of letters and characters ending in .onion </p>
<p>Now on your other machine:</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-server">Connecting to the server</h2>
<p>On your main machine you will have to do the following:</p>
<p>Have ssh, tor, and socat installed</p>
<p>After you have installed them you will have to edit the ssh config</p>
<p><code>vim .ssh/config</code></p>
<p>And paste the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Host NAME
 Hostname URL.onion
 User USER
 Port 22
 Proxycommand socat - SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:%h:%p,socksport=9050
</code></pre><p>You will have to change the NAME, URL and USER. The user is the user you want to connect as to your server and the url is the url you that ends in .onion from above.</p>
<p>Now save the file and exit.</p>
<p>Now edit the torrc file. Using your favorite text editor:</p>
<p><code>vim /etc/tor/torrc</code></p>
<p>Find the line that says SOCKSPort and uncomment it</p>
<p><code>SOCKSPort 9050</code></p>
<p>Restart the tor service</p>
<p><code>systemctl restart tor</code></p>
<p>To connect to the server run the following command:</p>
<p><code>ssh NAME</code></p>
<p>With NAME being the name that you gave to the server in the config file.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-nmap">What is nmap</h1>
<p>Nmap (Network Mapper) is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon . Nmap sends packets and examines the answers to find hosts and services on a computer network. For probing computer networks, Nmap offers a variety of functionalities, including host discovery, service detection, and operating system detection. Scripts that offer more sophisticated service discovery, vulnerability detection, and other features can extend these features. During a scan, Nmap can adjust to changing network conditions, such as latency and congestion.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Nmap is available for linux, windows , mac os and even bsd</p>
<p>If you are using linux you can install it using your package manager.</p>
<p>On apt</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install nmap</code></p>
<p>On dnf</p>
<p><code>sudo dnf install nmap</code></p>
<p>With pacman</p>
<p><code>sudo pacman -S nmap</code></p>
<p>On windows you have to download the executable from the nmap website.</p>
<p><a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">https://nmap.org/download.html</a></p>
<p>The same goes for mac and any other os</p>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>The first thing I will show you how to do is find all the ip addresses connected to your local network.</p>
<p>The first thing you will have to do is find your inet ip</p>
<p>On Linux type</p>
<p><code>ip a</code></p>
<p>On windows</p>
<p><code>ipconfig</code></p>
<p>You should see a lot of information, try to find inet. It should look something like this</p>
<p><code>inet 192.168.1.28/24</code></p>
<p>and copy the ip</p>
<p>Now type</p>
<p><code>nmap -sn IP</code></p>
<p>Instead of ip type the ip we found from above</p>
<p>Now you should see a large list of all the ips connected to your network.</p>
<p>-sn flag stands for no port scan</p>
<p>Now we can also get all the ports open on all the ips on your local network</p>
<p>To do that type</p>
<p><code>nmap IP</code></p>
<p>Instead of ip type the ip we found from above</p>
<p>Now if you have any computers on your local networks with open ports you should see them now</p>
<p>Eg.</p>
<p>I have a ssh port open on one of my machines so I can see</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
</code></pre><p>If you are running a web server ports 80 and 443 should be open.</p>
<p>Now lets say that you want to find out what operating system a specified device on your network is running.</p>
<p>To do that type</p>
<p><code>sudo nmap -O IP</code></p>
<p>Eg.</p>
<p><code>sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.16</code></p>
<p>In my case my device is running linux and you can even find out what kernel version your device is running</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 2.6.X
OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.32
OS details: Linux 2.6.32
</code></pre><p>You can press enter while running a scan to see how much time is left</p>
<p>Lets say that you dont want anyone monitoring a network be able to trace back the scan to you.</p>
<p>For that we can use decoy mode</p>
<p>To use decoy mode add -D followed by any random ip to any nmap command.</p>
<p>eg</p>
<p><code>sudo nmap -D 192.168.1.11 192.168.1.16</code></p>
<p>This will make it so that it looks like both your ip and 192.168.1.11 are performing a port scan on 192.168.1.16</p>
<p>You can also add multiple ips by adding commas</p>
<p>eg</p>
<p><code>sudo nmap -D 192.168.1.11,192.168.1.12 192.168.1.16</code></p>
<p>Thats all for now</p>
<p><strong>GG</strong> You have now learnt the basics of nmap

      <description>As the linuxfoundation states about 95% of cloud providers run kubernetes which is an open sourced solution, the Apache Web server powers millions of websites including netflix.com, spotify.com and more. Most of the Internets core functions are based on open source technology. But what is it and why is it so important?
What is open sourced software?
Open-source software is computer software that is distributed under a license that allows users to use, study, modify, and distribute the program and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.</description>

Most of the Internets core functions are based on open source technology. But what is it and why is it so important?</p>
<p>What is open sourced software?</p>
<p>Open-source software is computer software that is distributed under a license that allows users to use, study, modify, and distribute the program and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be created in a public, collaborative environment. Open-source software is a good example of open collaboration since it allows any skilled user to engage in development online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly there’s a phenomenon around open source. You know free software will be a vibrant area. There will be a lot of neat things that get done there.&rdquo;
-Bill Gates</p>
<h1 id="why-open-source">Why open source?</h1>
<p>There are several advantages to using open-source software.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust</strong>. One of the most important advantages is trust. As users can examine your code and make sure its not doing anything they don’t want it to. They are also able to change things they don’t like. Most cryptocurrency projects are open sourced to be able to develop trust with their community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community</strong> A open source community allows more developers to build around the project . Bitcoin is the greatest example of such a community. As soon as bitcoin source code was published many utilities for bitcoin were made like wallets and more which would never have been made if bitcoin wasn’t open sourced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> Anyone can read your source code and see if they want it to do what it is doing. That way your company gains a lot of trust.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Talk is cheap show me the code&rdquo;
Linus Torvalds</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous evolution</strong> Your project will continue to be developed even if you give up on it. Again the greatest example for this kind of project is bitcoin. Even though the founder of bitcoin has vanished for more than 10 years, cryptocurrency technology is &ldquo;changing&rdquo; the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Development costs</strong> (For companies) You can reduce your costs by using open source software. You can save money on licensing and maintenance. The only costs you’d have to deal with are those for documentation, media, support etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controll</strong> With open source YOU are ultimately in controll. If you dont like something you can modify the source code to your liking.</p>
</li>
