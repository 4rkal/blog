      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through how you can run your own gitea instance. But first
What is gitea? Gitea is a painless selfhosted Git service. It is written in go and is extremely lightweight. I run a gitea instance on my Le Potato and it barely uses any resources.
Why use gitea (vs GitHub, GitLab etc) I started running my own gitea instance since I wanted somewhere private to host my Obsidian notes.</description>

<h2 id="what-is-gitea">What is gitea?</h2>
<p>Gitea is a painless selfhosted Git service. It is written in go and is extremely lightweight. I run a gitea instance on my <a href="https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/">Le Potato</a> and it barely uses any resources.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-gitea-vs-github-gitlab-etc">Why use gitea (vs GitHub, GitLab etc)</h2>
<p>I started running my own gitea instance since I wanted somewhere private to host my <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> notes. I did not want to have them in a private GitHub repo since it&rsquo;s not on my own hardware. GitLab is harder to spin up and has a lot of features that I do not need.</p>
<p>If you want an easy to spin up private git service gitea is your way to go.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>In this guide I will be using debian 12. The setup should be the same on any other distribution since we will be using docker.</p>
<h2 id="installing-and-setting-up-docker">Installing and setting up docker</h2>
<p>The first thing you will need is docker installed on your system.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/">Install docker on debian</a></p>
<p>Also make sure to add your user to the docker group</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>usermod -aG docker $USER
</code></pre><p>Now reboot</p>
<h2 id="docker-composeyml">Docker-compose.yml</h2>
<p>Once we have docker installed. We have to get gitea up and running</p>
<p>First create a new directory. This will host our docker-compose file.</p>
<p><code>mkdir gitea</code></p>
<p>Then create/edit docker-compose.yml in your favourite text editor.</p>
<p><code>vim docker-compose.yml</code></p>
<p>Then paste the following content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">version</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;3&#34;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can change any of the default ports eg switching 3000 to 8000 can be done like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ports:
- &#34;8080:3000&#34;
</code></pre><p>You can setup gitea using a <a href="https://docs.gitea.com/installation/install-with-docker#postgresql-database">PostgreSQL</a> or <a href="https://docs.gitea.com/installation/install-with-docker#mysql-database">MySQL</a> database. But at least for my needs a simple SQLite3 database is more than enough.</p>
<p>Since I want my repositories to still exist even if the container is deleted I will use named volumes. The configuration file with named volumes should look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">version</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;3&#34;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="starting-the-container-and-additional-configuration">Starting the container and additional configuration</h2>
<p>Now you can start the container by typing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>docker compose up -d
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The -d flag will run it in detach mode. If you want to see the logs live you can remove it.</p>
<p>After docker is done pulling, gitea should be up and running.</p>
<p>Now open up:</p>
<p><code>localhost:3000</code> or <code>yourserverip:3000</code></p>
<p>And you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/gitea.png" type="" alt="Gitea Setup Dashboard"  /></p>
<p>Fill in all of the required information. Since I will be using my subdomain <code>git.4rkal.com</code> I set the server domain and gitea base url to that.</p>
<p>Here you will also have the option to enable sending emails for email verification and notifications. I will be enabling that by using a free (shitposting) email from <a href="https://cock.li">cock.li</a>.</p>
<p>After you have entered all the required info click on <code>Install Gitea</code>.</p>
<p>After the installation is complete you should be up and running</p>
<h1 id="make-publicly-accessible-with-cloudflare-tunnels-optional">Make publicly accessible with cloudflare tunnels (optional)</h1>
<p>I will be making my instance publicly accessible using cloudflare tunnels.</p>
<p>To do this you will need a cloudflare account and a domain pointed to cloudflare.</p>
<p>First head to the <a href="https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/">Zero Trust Dashboard</a></p>
<p>Under <code>Networks</code> click on <code>Tunnels</code> and then <code>Create a tunnel</code></p>
<p>Once created you should <code>Install and run a connector</code>, follow the instructions on the page for your specific setup.</p>
<p>After the connector is running you should click on the <code>Public Hostname</code> tab and <code>Add a public hostname</code>.</p>
<p>Now you should see something like this:
<img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/gitea2.png" type="" alt="Zero Trust Dashboard"  /></p>
<p>Fill in the info as I have.</p>
<p>You can  create a new subdomain eg git or gitea</p>
<p>The service type should be <code>HTTP</code> and the url should be <code>yourserverurl:3000</code></p>
<p>Now if you head to the domain that you specified you should see gitea up and running.</p>
<p>In my case you can access my public gitea instance at <a href="https://git.4rkal.com">git.4rkal.com</a></p>
<p>Congratulations, you now have your very own gitea instance!</p>

      <description>In this article I will show you how I securely connect to my remote machines without having to configure port forwarding.
Requirements: A computer &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; (running linux) A internet connection Another computer to connect to your server (running linux) Why? If you want to access your server without portforwarding in a extremely secure fashion you will want to follow this tutorial. You will be connecting to the server via tor which will make it harder for anyone to find the url of the server and ill show you how to setup keybased auth for even more security!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article I will show you how I securely connect to my remote machines without having to configure port forwarding.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements:</h2>
<ol>
<li>A computer &ldquo;server&rdquo; (running linux)</li>
<li>A internet connection</li>
<li>Another computer to connect to your server (running linux)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>If you want to access your server without portforwarding in a extremely secure fashion you will want to follow this tutorial. You will be connecting to the server via tor which will make it harder for anyone to find the url of the server and ill show you how to setup keybased auth for even more security!</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>You will have to install the following packages (ssh, tor)</p>
<p>On debian</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install openssh-client</code></p>
<p>On arch</p>
<p><code>sudo pacman -S openssh</code></p>
<p>After that enable the ssh service</p>
<p>Debian:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl enable ssh</code></p>
<p>Arch:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl enable sshd</code></p>
<p>If you want to check if this worked just use another computer and run</p>
<p><code>ssh USER@IP</code></p>
<p>for example I run</p>
<p><code>ssh arkal@192.168.1.69</code></p>
<p>After this you can enable KeyBased authentication for more security</p>
<p>Here is my article how to enable that :</p>
<p><a href="https://4rkal.eu.org/posts/sssh/">Enable keybased authentication</a></p>
<p>Now we need to install tor:</p>
<p>On debian</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install tor</code></p>
<p>On arch</p>
<p><code>sudo pacman -S tor</code></p>
<p>Then start and enable the tor service with</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl start tor &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl enable tor</code></p>
<p>After you have done that you want to edit your torrc file. Using your favorite text editor</p>
<p><code>sudo vim /etc/tor/torrc</code></p>
<p>Now you will want to navigate to the part that says HiddenService. And paste the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
</code></pre><p>Save your file and exit the editor (for nano cntrl s, cntrl x)</p>
<p>Now you want will have to restart the tor service</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl restart tor</code></p>
<p>After that run the following:</p>
<p><code>sudo cat /var/lib/tor/ssh/hostname</code></p>
<p>You should see a string of letters and characters ending in .onion </p>
<p>Now on your other machine:</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-server">Connecting to the server</h2>
<p>On your main machine you will have to do the following:</p>
<p>Have ssh, tor, and socat installed</p>
<p>After you have installed them you will have to edit the ssh config</p>
<p><code>vim .ssh/config</code></p>
<p>And paste the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Host NAME
 Hostname URL.onion
 User USER
 Port 22
 Proxycommand socat - SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:%h:%p,socksport=9050
</code></pre><p>You will have to change the NAME, URL and USER. The user is the user you want to connect as to your server and the url is the url you that ends in .onion from above.</p>
<p>Now save the file and exit.</p>
<p>Now edit the torrc file. Using your favorite text editor:</p>
<p><code>vim /etc/tor/torrc</code></p>
<p>Find the line that says SOCKSPort and uncomment it</p>
<p><code>SOCKSPort 9050</code></p>
<p>Restart the tor service</p>
<p><code>systemctl restart tor</code></p>
<p>To connect to the server run the following command:</p>
<p><code>ssh NAME</code></p>
<p>With NAME being the name that you gave to the server in the config file.</p>

      <description>What is PocketBase PocketBase is an open source backend made in go consisting of embedded database (SQLite) with realtime subscriptions, built-in auth management, convenient dashboard UI and simple REST-ish API.
Install PocketBase The first thing that you will have to do is head to https://pocketbase.io and select the file for your operating system. Since I am using linux I will show how to set this up on linux but it should be pretty similar for any other os.</description>

<h1 id="install-pocketbase">Install PocketBase</h1>
<p>The first thing that you will have to do is head to <a href="https://pocketbase.io">https://pocketbase.io</a> and select the file for your operating system. Since I am using linux I will show how to set this up on linux but it should be pretty similar for any other os.</p>
<p>Unzip the file and open up a terminal to the path that you extracted the file to and type:</p>
<p><code>./pocketbase serve</code></p>
<p>If you want to serve some static content you can create a new directory called pb_public</p>
<p><code>mkdir pb_public</code></p>
<p>Then paste any content into that directory</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&#34;UTF-8&#34;&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&#34;X-UA-Compatible&#34; content=&#34;IE=edge&#34;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&#34;viewport&#34; content=&#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&#34;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Epic Website&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My epic website&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>And save that as index.html inside of the pb_public folder</p>
<p>Now if you head to http://127.0.0.1:8090/ you should see the website that we entered above.</p>
<p>If you go to http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/ it will take you to an admin portal. There you should create a account. After you have setted up your account you should see something like this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pocketbase.webp" type="" alt="1"  /></p>
<p>Here you can add and create users</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pocketbase2.webp" type="" alt="2"  /></p>
<p>And also create custom collections eg</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pocketbase3.webp" type="" alt="2"  /></p>
<p>If you click on the settings icon you can see that you will be able to add applications, mail settings, file storage (s3) , export/import collections, add or remove auth providers, token options and add/remove admins.</p>
<p>That’s it for now if you want to learn more check out <a href="https://pocketbase.io/docs/">https://pocketbase.io/docs/</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are numerous benefits to running your own git server as opposed to Github . Your code cannot be used for profit . Additionally, nobody can delete your code base .</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ol>
<li>A computer for your server (running [[linux]] preferably debian)</li>
<li>An internet connection (pretty hard without one)</li>
<li>A second computer with git installed</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>The first thing you will have to do is install git via your package manager</p>
<p>If you are using apt</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install git</code></p>
<p>On dnf</p>
<p><code>sudo dnf install git</code></p>
<p>pacman</p>
<p><code>sudo pacman -S git</code></p>
<p>After that create a user called git</p>
<p><code>sudo useradd git</code></p>
<p>You will have to enter some information, you can leave everything except the password blank.</p>
<p>Now login to your git user</p>
<p><code>su git</code></p>
<p>Now to make our server more secure we are going to use ssh keys.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh/
touch .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre><p>Now on the computer which you want to commit from you will have to generate a ssh key
On your main machine type.
<a href="../sssh">My article on keybased auth</a></p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen</code></p>
<p>After that you will have to copy your ssh public key to the authorized_keys</p>
<p><code>ssh-copy-id user@ip</code></p>
<p>(To find out your ip you can type ifconfig)</p>
<p>Now if you try to connect to your server you should be able to login without a password.</p>
<p><code>ssh git@ip</code></p>
<p>Now you will have to create the folder where all your git repos will be saved.</p>
<p>I will save mine in ~/git , but you can save them wherever you want</p>
<p><code>mkdir ~/git</code></p>
<p>Now we have to give the ownership of the git folder to the git user</p>
<p><code>chown git:git git</code></p>
<p>Now for every repository you will have to create a folder.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<p><code>mkdir ~/git/my_cool_project.git</code></p>
<p>Now run</p>
<p><code>cd ~/git/my_cool_project.git</code></p>
<p>And initiate the git repository</p>
<p><code>git init --bare</code></p>
<p>Now you can create a couple of files inside of your project (to test it out).</p>
<p><code>touch stuff.txt</code></p>
<p>Now you can test if your repository is working by cloning the files from another machine running git.</p>
<p><code>git clone git@ip:~/git/my_cool_project.git</code></p>
<p>You will probably get</p>
<p><code>warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.</code></p>
<p>That is because you haven&rsquo;t committed anything.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git add .
git commit -m &#34;first commit&#34;
</code></pre><p>Now if you test that again it should work.</p>
<p><strong>GG</strong> you did it, you have now successfully set up your own git server</p>

      <description>We rely on google more and more, but it’s interesting to know how much data Google is now handling. Alphabet aka Google describes its extensive data collection practices in its privacy policy. The company stores an astounding quantity of data. An estimated 15 exabytes of YOUR data are stored by Google. Google is tracking your every move.

<h1 id="what-is-searx">What is searX?</h1>
<p>Searx is a free and open-source metasearch engine, available under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3, with the aim of protecting the privacy of its users. In order to do this, Searx does not provide the search engines from which it receives results with users’ IP addresses or search histories. Tracking cookies served by the search engines are blocked, preventing user-profiling-based results modification.</p>
<p>Users can run private instances of Searx on their own computer, but there are also many public, user-run, Searx instances.</p>
<p>In this article i will show you how to run your own searX instance.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-metasearch-engine">What is a metasearch engine?</h1>
<p>A web search engine’s data is used by a metasearch engine, an online information retrieval tool, to create its own results. Metasearch engines automatically query search engines eg Google after receiving user input. The users are shown sufficient data that has been gathered, sorted, and presented.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ol>
<li>An computer (preferably running linux). Check out my article on how to install linux here <a href="https://4rkal.medium.com/install-a-debian-server-54add9133eec">https://4rkal.medium.com/install-a-debian-server-54add9133eec</a></li>
<li>an internet connection</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="installing-on-windows">Installing on windows</h1>
<p>To install on windows you will have to install wsl and follow the setup guide for linux bellow</p>
<p>To see how to install wsl head to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a></p>
<h1 id="installing-on-linux-debian">Installing on Linux (debian)</h1>
<p>First update your system
<code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</code>
Now install required packages
<code>sudo apt install -y python3-dev python3-babel python3-venv uwsgi uwsgi-plugin-python3 git build-essential libxslt-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev </code>
Now you will have to create a new user called searx</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo -H useradd --shell /bin/bash --system \
    --home-dir &#34;/usr/local/searx&#34; \
    --comment &#39;Privacy-respecting metasearch engine&#39; searx

sudo -H mkdir &#34;/usr/local/searx&#34;
sudo -H chown -R &#34;searx:searx&#34; &#34;/usr/local/searx&#34;
</code></pre><p>Now change user to searx</p>
<p><code>git clone &quot;https://github.com/searx/searx.git&quot; &quot;/usr/local/searx/searx-src&quot;t</code></p>
<p>Now create a virtual environment</p>
<p><code>echo &quot;. /usr/local/searx/searx-pyenv/bin/activate&quot; &gt;&gt;  &quot;/usr/local/searx/.profile&quot;</code></p>
<p>To install searx’s dependencies, exit the searx bash session you opened above and restart a new. Before install, first check if your virtualenv was sourced from the login (~/.profile):</p>
<p>Update dependencies</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pip install -U pip
pip install -U setuptools
pip install -U wheel
pip install -U pyyaml
</code></pre><p>Jump to searx’s working tree and install searx into virtualenv</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd &#34;/usr/local/searx/searx-src&#34;
pip install -e .
</code></pre><p>Now go back to your default user</p>
<p><code>exit</code></p>
<p>And type
<code>sudo -H mkdir -p &quot;/etc/searx&quot;</code></p>
<p>Then</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo -H cp &#34;/usr/local/searx/searx-src/utils/templates/etc/searx/use_default_settings.yml&#34; \
             &#34;/etc/searx/settings.yml&#34;
</code></pre><p>Now you can edit your settings file</p>
<p><code>sudo nano /etc/searx/settings.yml</code></p>
<p>You can change the secret_key</p>
<p>I will change the port and bind_address but you can change whatever you want.</p>
<p>Now log back in to your searx user</p>
<p><code>sudo -H -u searx -i</code></p>
<p>Change directory</p>
<p><code>cd /usr/local/searx/searx-src</code></p>
<p>Export the settings path</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>export 
SEARX_SETTINGS_PATH=&#34;/etc/searx/settings.yml&#34;
</code></pre><p>Finally run the web app
<code>python searx/webapp.py</code>
Now if you head to 127.0.0.1:8888 you should be able to see something like this

      <description>In this article, I will show you how to set up Pi-hole. Pi-hole will allow you to block in-app ads, improve your network&amp;rsquo;s performance, and monitor statistics. Pi-hole also allows you to create a VPN.
What is Pi-hole? Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application that acts as a DNS sinkhole and optionally a DHCP server, intended for use on a private network. It is designed for low-power embedded devices with network capability, such as the Raspberry Pi, but can be installed on any Linux machine.</description>

<h1 id="what-is-pi-hole">What is Pi-hole?</h1>
<p>Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application that acts as a DNS sinkhole and optionally a DHCP server, intended for use on a private network. It is designed for low-power embedded devices with network capability, such as the Raspberry Pi, but can be installed on any Linux machine. Pi-hole has the ability to block traditional website advertisements as well as advertisements in unconventional places, such as smart TVs and mobile operating system advertisements.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ol>
<li>A computer with Linux (preferably something Debian-based)</li>
<li>Preferably an Ethernet cable</li>
<li>Access to your router&rsquo;s admin portal</li>
<li>A static IP</li>
<li>An internet connection (it&rsquo;s pretty difficult without one, trust me)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>The first thing we have to do is download the installer.</p>
<p>To do that, type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, install it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo bash basic-install.sh
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/1.webp" type="" alt="Installation Step 1"  /></p>
<p>Just press OK.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/2.webp" type="" alt="Installation Step 2"  /></p>
<p>Just press OK again.</p>
<p>As I said before, you have to have a static IP in order to set up the Pi-hole, so if you have one configured, just press Yes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/3.webp" type="" alt="Static IP Setup"  /></p>
<p>Otherwise, you will have to set one up.</p>
<p>Now you will be prompted to select your upstream DNS provider. You can select any of the DNS providers on the list. I will just select Google.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/4.webp" type="" alt="DNS Provider Selection"  /></p>
<p>And press OK.</p>
<p>After that, you will have to select your list. I will just select the default one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/5.webp" type="" alt="List Selection"  /></p>
<p>Now you will have to select whether you want a web admin interface. Select On and then OK.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/6.webp" type="" alt="Web Admin Interface"  /></p>
<p>Now just select On and press OK.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/7.webp" type="" alt="Web Admin Interface Confirmation"  /></p>
<p>After that, you can select if you want to log queries. You can select any option you want.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/8.webp" type="" alt="Log Queries"  /></p>
<p>Now, I recommend that you leave this as default, but you don’t have to.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/9.webp" type="" alt="Default Settings"  /></p>
<p>Now it should start installing everything.</p>
<p>After the installation is finished, you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/10.webp" type="" alt="Installation Complete"  /></p>
<p>You have now successfully installed Pi-hole. You can head to the admin portal by going to the specified IP.</p>
<p>To be able to use Pi-hole, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the IP the default DNS for your whole network</li>
<li>Manually add it on any device</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go with the second option.</p>
<h3 id="on-windows">On Windows:</h3>
<p>DNS settings are specified in the TCP/IP Properties window for the selected network connection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Control Panel</li>
<li>Click Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change adapter settings</li>
<li>Select the connection for which you want to configure</li>
<li>Right-click Local Area Connection &gt; Properties</li>
<li>Select the Networking tab</li>
<li>Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)</li>
<li>Click Properties</li>
<li>Click Advanced</li>
<li>Select the DNS tab</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
<li>Select Use the following DNS server addresses</li>
<li>Replace those addresses with the IP addresses of your Pi</li>
<li>Restart the connection you selected in step 3</li>
<li>Repeat the procedure for additional network connections you want to change</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="on-linux">On Linux:</h3>
<p>In most modern Linux distributions, DNS settings are configured through Network Manager.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click System &gt; Preferences &gt; Network Connections</li>
<li>Select the connection for which you want to configure and press <strong>Edit</strong></li>
<li>Select the IPv4 Settings or IPv6 Settings tab</li>
<li>If the selected method is Automatic (DHCP), open the dropdown and select Automatic (DHCP) addresses only instead. If the method is set to something else, do not change it.</li>
<li>In the DNS servers field, enter your Pi’s IP addresses</li>
<li>Click Apply to save the changes</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you are not using Network Manager, your DNS settings are specified in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if we head over to any websites with ads, you should see that no ads appear.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try speedtest.net.</p>
<p>If you have followed the steps correctly, you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/../assets/pihole/ads.webp" type="" alt="No Ads!"  /></p>
<p><strong>NO ADS</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy the ad-free web.</p>

      <description>SSH keys provide an extremely secure way of logging into your server.
SSH Password Based VS Key Based Authentication Clients can be authenticated by an SSH server in a variety of ways. The most basic is password authentication, which is simple to use but not particularly secure. The more advanced and secure way is via ssh keys.Brute-forcing a password-protected account is quite possible thanks to modern computing power and automated scripts.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SSH keys provide an extremely secure way of logging into your server.</p>
<h1 id="ssh-password-based-vs-key-based-authentication">SSH Password Based VS Key Based Authentication</h1>
<p>Clients can be authenticated by an SSH server in a variety of ways. The most basic is password authentication, which is simple to use but not particularly secure. The more advanced and secure way is via ssh keys.Brute-forcing a password-protected account is quite possible thanks to modern computing power and automated scripts. The solution to that is ssh key based authentication.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-key-based-authentication-work">How does Key Based Authentication work?</h1>
<p>SSH key pairs are two cryptographically secure keys that allow a client to connect to an SSH server. A public key and a private key make up each key pair.The client keeps the private key, which should be kept completely confidential.</p>
<p>If the attacker has access to the private key, they will be able to enter into servers using the corresponding public key without requiring further authentication. A passphrase can be used to encrypt the key on disc as an extra precaution.</p>
<p>The related public key can be freely shared without causing any harm. The public key can be used to encrypt communications that can only be decrypted with the private key. This attribute is used to verify the authenticity of the key pair. The public key is placed on a distant server that you wish to use SSH to access. The key is saved in a special file called /.ssh/authorized keys in the user account you’ll be login into.</p>
<p>When a client uses SSH keys to authenticate, the server can check if the client has the private key. A shell session is started or the requested command is executed if the client can verify ownership of the private key.</p>
<h1 id="setting-up">Setting up</h1>
<p>The first thing we will have to to do is generate an SSH key pair on your local computer.</p>
<p>To do that type</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen</code></p>
<p>You should see something like this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/4rkal/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
</code></pre><p>If you want to you can enter a passphrase to encrypt the private key.</p>
<p>After that your key should be generated.</p>
<p>Now you will have to copy your public key to your server.</p>
<p>To do that type</p>
<p><code>ssh-copy-id username@host_ip</code></p>
<p>(find your servers ip by typing ifconfig in your server)</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<p>`ssh-copy-id <a href="mailto:server@192.168.1.13">server@192.168.1.13</a>'</p>
<p>Try to ssh into your server by typing</p>
<p><code>ssh username@host_ip</code></p>
<p>You should be able to login into your server without the password. However, brute force attacks continue to threaten your server. Now we have to disable password based authentication.</p>
<p>First login to your ssh server by typing
<code>ssh username@host_ip</code></p>
<p>Now we have edit the ssh config</p>
<p>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</p>
<p>You should see a large file that starts with</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#       $OpenBSD: sshd_config,v 1.103 2018/04/09 20:41:22 tj Exp $
</code></pre><p>At this point press cntrl w and search for <code>PasswordAuthentication</code></p>
<p>Uncomment the line that says</p>
<p><code>#PasswordAuthentication yes</code></p>
<p>And change it to</p>
<p><code>PasswordAuthentication no</code></p>
<p>Now press cntrl s to save and cntrl x to exit</p>
<p>After that restart the ssh service with</p>
<p><code>sudo service ssh restart</code></p>
<p>Now try to ssh into your server from another machine or a vm and you should see something like this</p>
<p><code>server@192.168.1.13: Permission denied (publickey)</code></p>

      <description>In this article i will be showing you how to host your “dark web” aka Tor website for free.
What is Tor? Tor — short for the Onion Routing project — is an open-source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing. The worldwide Tor computer network uses secure, encrypted protocols to ensure that users’ online privacy is protected. Tor users’ digital data and communications are shielded using a layered approach that resembles the nested layers of an onion.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article i will be showing you how to host your “dark web” aka Tor website for free.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-tor">What is Tor?</h1>
<p>Tor — short for the Onion Routing project — is an open-source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing. The worldwide Tor computer network uses secure, encrypted protocols to ensure that users’ online privacy is protected. Tor users’ digital data and communications are shielded using a layered approach that resembles the nested layers of an onion.</p>
<h1 id="why-use-tor">Why use Tor?</h1>
<p>Tor is useful for anyone who wants to keep their internet activities out of the hands of advertisers, ISPs, and websites. That includes people getting around censorship restrictions in their country, people looking to hide their IP address, or anyone else who doesn’t want their browsing habits linked to them.</p>
<p>The Tor network may also host webpages that only other Tor users can view. In other words, you’ve entered the Dark Web, which consists of websites that aren’t indexed by the standard crawlers you use to look for products to purchase, and quiz answers etc . On the Dark Web, you can discover everything from free textbooks to drugs — and worse — as long as you know the secret URL that leads to these sites.</p>
<h1 id="tor-websites">Tor Websites</h1>
<p>Just like any other website, you will need to know the address of an onion service in order to connect to it. An onion address is a string of 56 mostly random letters and numbers, followed by “.onion”.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ol>
<li>A linux machine (debian preferably)</li>
<li>An internet connection (pretty hard without one,trust me)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>The first thing we will have to do is install Tor</p>
<p><code>apt install tor</code></p>
<p>Now we will have to enable tor hidden service(which is the website) for that type:</p>
<p><code>sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc</code></p>
<p>You should see a large configuration file, search for <code>HiddenService</code></p>
<p>You will have to uncoment:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
</code></pre><p>Now press cntrl s and then cntrl x to exit</p>
<p>After that start the tor service by running</p>
<p><code>sudo service tor start</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl start tor</code></p>
<p>Now we also have to install nginx to be able to run our website to do that type</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install nginx</code></p>
<p>Start the nginx service with the systemctl or service command</p>
<p>Now we also have to install nginx to be able to run our website to do that type</p>
<p><code>sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname</code></p>
<p>You should see a address that looks something like this</p>
<p><code>tiur7p652svsaemdewbsxnnkrj3b35ny2rx454od5wk5ivfqhijm2qd.onion</code></p>
<p>Now open your tor browser and paste your address and press enter.</p>
<p>You will most probably be greeted by the default nginx site.</p>
<p>This page is easily customized, you can check out my article:
<a href="https://4rkal.com/posts/shwebsite/">here</a></p>
<p>GG you did it you are now running a pretty anonymous website on the tor network.</p>

<p>Lets get started!</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>The first thing that we will have to do is setup our nginx site.</p>
<p>We first have to be root</p>
<p><code>sudo su</code></p>
<p>If you dont have sudo installed try:</p>
<p><code>su -</code></p>
<p>Now we will have to install nginx</p>
<p><code>apt install nginx</code></p>
<p>If you are using any other package manager install it using the package name nginx</p>
<p>Now we will have to start the nginx service</p>
<p><code>systemctl start nginx</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>service nginx start</code></p>
<p>Lets find your ip with:</p>
<p><code>ip a</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>ifconfig</code></p>
<p>If you open a web browser and go to your ip you should see the default welcome to nginx site.</p>
<p>Since we want to make our website as secure as possible we can hide the nginx version</p>
<p>To do that type</p>
<p>`sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf</p>
<p>Now you should see the nginx configuration file.</p>
<p>under</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>http {
##
        # Basic Settings
        ##
sendfile on;
        tcp_nopush on;
        types_hash_max_size 2048;
        # server_tokens off;
</code></pre><p>uncomment <code>server_tokens off;</code></p>
<p>Now restart your nginx service</p>
<p><code>systemctl restart nginx</code></p>
<p>We can now enter our html files inside of <code>/var/www/html</code></p>
<p>To do that type:</p>
<p><code>cd /usr/share/nginx/html</code></p>
<p>and now we can create the index.html file</p>
<p><code>nano index.html</code></p>
<p>and paste/write your html code to index.html</p>
<p>Now restart the nginx service again</p>
<p><code>systemctl restart nginx</code></p>
<h1 id="certbot">Certbot</h1>
<p>Now we will install cerbot in order to get https</p>
<p>To install certbot simply type</p>
<p><code>apt install certbot python-certbot-nginx</code></p>
<p>Now we will have to run certbot</p>
<p><code>certbot --nginx</code></p>
<p>Enter all the inf oand agree to the terms</p>
<p>After that you will have to enter the name you would like to activate https for</p>
<p>Just select the names</p>
<p>After that select to redirect http to https</p>
<h1 id="port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h1>
<p>There are a few ways to port forward. In this article we will use noip.com.</p>
<p>Head over to noip.com to get started (Use my referal <a href="https://www.noip.com/?fpr=4rkal">https://www.noip.com/?fpr=4rkal</a>)</p>
<p>Create an account and register a hostname</p>
<p>After that we will have to build the noip client on our computer for that paste these commands to your terminal</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd /usr/local/src
wget http://www.no-ip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
tar xzf noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
cd noip-2.1.9–1
make
make install
</code></pre><p>When you run make install you will be prompted to answer some questions like your login information and the update interval</p>
<p>In the update interval just set it to 30</p>
<p>Then if you don’t want to run something at a successful update type n if you do then type y.</p>
<p>You will now also have to edit the nginx default settings</p>
<p>to do that type</p>
<p>`sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default</p>
<p>Now you will have to change the server_name to the domain you registered at noip.com</p>
<p>You can check if your configuration was successful by running</p>
<p><code>nginx -t</code></p>
<p>You can now restart the nginx service</p>
<p><code>systemctl restart nginx</code></p>
<p>Now if you head to your domain it should be working and ssl should be installed</p>

<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ol>
<li>Raspberry pi or any other computer</li>
<li>Web cam</li>
<li>Any kind of debian based distro installed on the pi/computer</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>In this article we will be using the motion package (<a href="https://motion-project.github.io/">https://motion-project.github.io/</a>)</p>
<p>To get started power on your raspberry pi and ssh into the machine or just connect it to a monitor and a keyboard. Also connect your web cam to the raspberry pi usb port.</p>
<p>The first thing we will have to do is install motion, for that type the following command:<br>
<code>apt install motion</code><br>
Now start motion with:<br>
<code>systemctl start motion</code><br>
or<br>
<code>service motion start</code><br>
Now we are going to change some of the default settings . To do that type:<br>
<code>nano /etc/motion/motion.conf</code><br>
The first thing that we are going to change is<br>
<code>webcontrol_localhost off</code><br>
This will enable us to access the stream from other computers.</p>
<p>To view the stream run:</p>
<p><code>motion</code></p>
<p>If you get a permission denied error try running</p>
<p><code>sudo motion</code></p>
<p>If you got to http://YOUR_IP:8080 you should see a live feed of the web cam</p>
<p>You can change the port under webcontrol_port in the config file eg.
<code>webcontrol_port 1234</code></p>
<p>If you only want the live stream port you can go to http://your_ip:8081</p>
<p>Again you can change that under stream_port.</p>
<p>Now everything should be working fine. All motion detection files will be saved in /var/lib/motion</p>
<p>You can also change loads of other settings. Here are my settings: <a href="https://pastebin.com/WGn0NfcW">https://pastebin.com/WGn0NfcW</a></p>
