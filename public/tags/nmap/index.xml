<h1 id="what-is-nmap">What is nmap</h1>
<p>Nmap (Network Mapper) is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon . Nmap sends packets and examines the answers to find hosts and services on a computer network. For probing computer networks, Nmap offers a variety of functionalities, including host discovery, service detection, and operating system detection. Scripts that offer more sophisticated service discovery, vulnerability detection, and other features can extend these features. During a scan, Nmap can adjust to changing network conditions, such as latency and congestion.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Nmap is available for linux, windows , mac os and even bsd</p>
<p>If you are using linux you can install it using your package manager.</p>
<p>On apt</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install nmap</code></p>
<p>On dnf</p>
<p><code>sudo dnf install nmap</code></p>
<p>With pacman</p>
<p><code>sudo pacman -S nmap</code></p>
<p>On windows you have to download the executable from the nmap website.</p>
<p><a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">https://nmap.org/download.html</a></p>
<p>The same goes for mac and any other os</p>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>The first thing I will show you how to do is find all the ip addresses connected to your local network.</p>
<p>The first thing you will have to do is find your inet ip</p>
<p>On Linux type</p>
<p><code>ip a</code></p>
<p>On windows</p>
<p><code>ipconfig</code></p>
<p>You should see a lot of information, try to find inet. It should look something like this</p>
<p><code>inet 192.168.1.28/24</code></p>
<p>and copy the ip</p>
<p>Now type</p>
<p><code>nmap -sn IP</code></p>
<p>Instead of ip type the ip we found from above</p>
<p>Now you should see a large list of all the ips connected to your network.</p>
<p>-sn flag stands for no port scan</p>
<p>Now we can also get all the ports open on all the ips on your local network</p>
<p>To do that type</p>
<p><code>nmap IP</code></p>
<p>Instead of ip type the ip we found from above</p>
<p>Now if you have any computers on your local networks with open ports you should see them now</p>
<p>Eg.</p>
<p>I have a ssh port open on one of my machines so I can see</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
</code></pre><p>If you are running a web server ports 80 and 443 should be open.</p>
<p>Now lets say that you want to find out what operating system a specified device on your network is running.</p>
<p>To do that type</p>
<p><code>sudo nmap -O IP</code></p>
<p>Eg.</p>
<p><code>sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.16</code></p>
<p>In my case my device is running linux and you can even find out what kernel version your device is running</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 2.6.X
OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.32
OS details: Linux 2.6.32
</code></pre><p>You can press enter while running a scan to see how much time is left</p>
<p>Lets say that you dont want anyone monitoring a network be able to trace back the scan to you.</p>
<p>For that we can use decoy mode</p>
<p>To use decoy mode add -D followed by any random ip to any nmap command.</p>
<p>eg</p>
<p><code>sudo nmap -D 192.168.1.11 192.168.1.16</code></p>
<p>This will make it so that it looks like both your ip and 192.168.1.11 are performing a port scan on 192.168.1.16</p>
<p>You can also add multiple ips by adding commas</p>
<p>eg</p>
<p><code>sudo nmap -D 192.168.1.11,192.168.1.12 192.168.1.16</code></p>
<p>Thats all for now</p>
<p><strong>GG</strong> You have now learnt the basics of nmap
