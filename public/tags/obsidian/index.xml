      <description>In this post I go through how I have setup my Obsidian and Hugo blogging workflow. I use a single vault and auto publish my articles with hotkeys.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you clicked on this article you probably know what these two technologies are but if you don&rsquo;t here&rsquo;s a quick explanation:</p>
<h3 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h3>
<p><a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> is a feature packed markdown editor. But it&rsquo;s not just a markdown editor. It&rsquo;s a way to manage knowledge. It&rsquo;s great for organizing your thoughts in a flexible, non-linear way.</p>
<p>Obsidian works on all platforms. So you can write articles from basically any platform.</p>
<p>I have been taking all of my notes in it for a couple of months now and it&rsquo;s amazing!</p>
<h3 id="hugo">Hugo</h3>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> is an ultra fast static website generator made in golang. I have been using hugo for my blog for almost 2 years now. I recently switched the theme of my my blog. Read more about the change <a href="https://4rkal.eu.org/posts/newlook?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_campaign=obsidianhugo">New Look, new start</a>.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>The following setup gives you the most control over the look and feel of your website without having a very complex setup. I believe it is a lot better than <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Obsidian Publish</a> for those reasons.</p>
<p>In this article I will not be showing how to setup these two technologies but merely how to get them to work together.</p>

<p>If you wan&rsquo;t a good guide on how to use obsidian read:
<a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian">Getting started - obsidian.md</a></p>
<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
<p>My goals for the setup are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a single <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault">obsidian vault</a></li>
<li>Have an easy to use <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates">obsidian template</a> that I can use for my blog posts.</li>
<li>Keep my personal vault folders private.</li>
<li>Auto publish using obsidian hotkeys.</li>
<li>Have all markdown files in a <a href="https://github.com/4rkal/blog/">public github repository</a>, so that people can propose changes</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="existing-setup">Existing setup</h1>
<p>The way that my current work flow works is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit articles from the content folder.</li>
<li>Run hugo command.</li>
<li>Push to github.</li>
<li><a href="https://render.com">Render.com</a> automatically picks up the changes and serves them.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="journey">Journey</h1>
<p><em>If you want to skip the journey part you can go straight to <a href="#the-sauce">The Sauce</a></em></p>
<p>I will be going through a couple of mistakes that I made while setting this up.</p>
<h3 id="mistake-1">Mistake #1</h3>
<p>The first idea that I had was to create a simple symlink (I use linux btw) that would link the two folders together.</p>
<p>Basically I have two folders:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>blog/
vault/
</code></pre><p>The blog folder contains all the blog folders and the vault is my personal vault.</p>
<p>The symlink would link these folders</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>blog/content
vault/Blog
</code></pre><p>However <strong>the problem</strong> with a symlink is that the folder content is not visible in my git repo.
This means that people can not propose changes to any of my articles</p>
<h3 id="mistake-2">Mistake #2</h3>
<p>I wanted to have my folders synced. I tried writing a couple of bash scripts that automatically synced the two folders using a cronjob.
However having that constantly running the background is a waste of resources when I am not writing.
Simply running the scripts via cli is just not that smooth.</p>
<h1 id="the-sauce">The Sauce</h1>
<p>Basically the way that I have set this up is I have two folders:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>blog
vault
</code></pre><p>The blog folder contains all the necessary hugo files and also has a sub directory called content that houses all of the markdown blog files.</p>
<p>I created a new folder inside of my vault called Blog</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>blog/content
vault/Blog
</code></pre><p>After that I copied over all of my files from the content directory to the Blog.</p>
<p><em>I then started writing this very article</em></p>
<h2 id="obsidian-templates">Obsidian templates</h2>
<p>I needed some way to setup a simple template to contain all of the required hugo front matter.</p>
<p>That is quite easy.</p>
<p>Read about how to setup templates <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates">Templates - obsidian.md</a></p>
<p>I created a file called <code>Blog Post</code> in my templates folder</p>
<p>My <code>Blog Post</code> template contains the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>---
title: &#34;{{Title}}&#34;
description: 
date: &#34;{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}T{{time:HH:mm:ss}}+00:00&#34;
draft: true
---

</code></pre><p>I have all the required front matter including a title, description and a date in the format that hugo asks.</p>
<p>I also added a small donation text that I include at the bottom of every article.</p>
<p>This means that I can automatically insert this template into any file and start writing!</p>
<h2 id="folder-syncing">Folder Syncing</h2>
<p>Now I want all of my files in my vault/Blog directory to be copied over to the blog/content</p>
<p>Thank&rsquo;s to a helpful discord user I found the <a href="https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands">obsidian-shellcommands</a> plugin.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this plugin does not currently work very well with the flatpak version of obsidian (since flatpak isolates the environment) . Using another alternative (.deb or appimage) seems to work.</p>
<p>It allows you to run shell commands in the background with a hotkey.</p>
<p>The steps to set this up are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=shell%20commands">Install the plugin</a></li>
<li>Enable the plugin</li>
<li>Go to the plugin options</li>
<li>Click on <code>New shell command</code></li>
<li>Now you will need to enter a shell command to copy the files from the one folder to the other.</li>
</ol>
<p>On Linux/MacOS that is:</p>
<p><code>cp -a ~/folder1/. ~/folder2/</code></p>
<p>in my case that is <code>cp -a ~/Documents/vault/Blog/. ~/Documents/blog/content/</code></p>
<p>On windows it most probably is:</p>
<p><code>robocopy &quot;%USERPROFILE%\folder1&quot; &quot;%USERPROFILE%\folder2&quot; /E /COPYALL</code></p>
<p>After that we need to set a hotkey that will run the command</p>
<p>Click on the (+) icon to go to the hotkey settings and assign a hotkey</p>
<p>My hotkey is <code>CTR + 0</code>, simply because that was available.</p>
<p>Now every time that I run the hotkey it copies over all of my files to the hugo folder ready to be published</p>
<h2 id="auto-publishing-scripts">Auto publishing scripts</h2>
<p>I also want to be able to automatically publish my articles. But I want it to happen when hitting a hotkey.</p>
<p>I wrote a small script that does exactly that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>cd ~/Documents/blog
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git add .
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git commit -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;new&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git push -u origin main
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This script will build my website, commit and push to my github repo, where it is picked up and published.

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to make the script executable by running</p>
<p><code>chmod +x ./YOURSCRIPT.sh</code></p>
<p>Then create a new shell command for the shellcommand plugin (as we did before) and enter the path to your script.</p>
<p>In my case that is:</p>
<p><code>~/Documents/blog/push.sh</code></p>
<p>Then enter a hotkey and you&rsquo;re done!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I can now simply open my obsidian vault, create a new file, insert my template and have all the info automatically entered.</p>
<p>I then write my article inside of obsidian</p>
<p>Run my hotkey and copy all the files into the hugo directory</p>
<p>Hit another key and my blog is published!</p>
