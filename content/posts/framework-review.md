In this article I will reviewing the framework 13 AMD version.

## Specs
6 months ago I purchased a machine with the following specs:
- AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5 7640U (up to 4.9GHz, 6-core/12-thread)
- 16 GB of  DDR5-5600 memory
- 500 GB NVMe
- Battery 55Wh

I am currently running fedora 41 (and windows 11) and everything is working extremely smoothly and out of the box.

## Why framework?
The answer is quite simple, as a tech enthusiast I want to be able to have a computer that I can tinker with and customize as much as I want. When compared with alternatives (mostly macs) being locked down to a single operating system or amount of storage or memory or even processor family surely doesn't sound very fun. Well with framework you can upgrade everything from the screen to the keyboard and yes even the mainboard (you can currently choose between intel and amd, and soon risc-v)
