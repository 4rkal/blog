#### I recently switched from the hugo [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) theme to [PaperModX](https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX/) .

## Why the switch?

- The LoveIt theme hasn't been updated in 2+ years.
- PaperModX has a more modern look
- LoveIt doesn't work that well with [obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

The overall switch wen't pretty smoothly. You can see the changes I made in this [commit](https://github.com/4rkal/blog).

## More articles to come!
The theme wasn't the only change that I made. After a pretty long break, I have decided to start publishing articles regularly again! 

So, stay tuned - There's more content to come!
