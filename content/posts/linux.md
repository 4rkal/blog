## What even is Linux?
Linux is a family of free and open source operating systems based on the [Linux kernel](https://kernel.org/).

Although being completely free (unlike alternatives) Linux currently only has [4.5% of the global desktop operating system market](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide), a very low percentage. 

## What makes Linux great?
The core difference between Linux and other mainstream desktop operating systems (windows, macOS) is the fact that it is **free and open source**. This allows it to be:
1. **Highly performant** - Linux is often faster and more efficient than its counterparts.
2. **Free from spyware and ads** -  Unlike Windows 11 which is [adding ads to the start menu](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24138949/microsoft-windows-11-start-menu-ads-recommendations-setting-disable)
3. **Arguably more secure** - Being open source often makes it more secure
4. **[Endlessly customizable](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)**
5. **Completely free forever** - Because it is published under a free and open source GPL license. 
6. and much much more

Read [The importance of open source software](https://4rkal.com/posts/opensource) for more information about open source software and it's superiority. 

If Windows and macOS are like apartments with rules and restrictions on what you can change, then Linux is like a house that you own that you can renovate, decorate and modify any way you like.

## If Linux is so great why isn't everyone using it?
We (all Linux users) can probably agree that the main drawback of Linux is user-friendliness. The average user never cared and will never care about what bootloader their laptop is using.

The fun part however is that most people are using Linux, they just don't know it!
### Android
Android is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world. With a staggering [71% of the global mobile operating system market](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide) 

A lesser known fact is that android is based on the Linux kernel.

So basically 71% of smartphones are running Linux!

### Servers
Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top one million web servers' operating systems are Linux) 
It also leads other systems such as mainframe computers, and is used on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers.

This website is being served from a Linux server. 

The majority if not all of the websites that you visit every single day are being served from a Linux server.

### IoT and embedded systems
Most IoT (Internet Of Things) devices run Linux because of it's lightweight nature and robustness. [This article](https://ubuntu.com/blog/eclipse-2018-survey-the-iot-landscape-what-it-empirically-looks-like) from 2018 suggests that 71% of IoT devices run Linux

Most embedded systems (smart TV's, routers etc) run Linux

## Conclusion
Linux is quietly running behind the scenes. It may only capture a small slice of the desktop operating system market but it's a huge player in mobile, server and IoT spaces. In fact a majority of people are using Linux daily without even realizing it! It’s in your phone, your favorite websites and countless devices around you.

Ultimately I highly recommend anyone interested to at least try and play around with Linux (especially if you are in the IT field I feel like it's a must)
