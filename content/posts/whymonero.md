In this article I will tell you why monero fits my views of what a cryptocurrency should look like.

# What is monero?
Monero is a decentralized cryptocurrency. It uses a public distributed ledger with privacy-enhancing technologies that obfuscate transactions to achieve anonymity and fungibility. Observers cannot decipher addresses trading monero, transaction amounts, address balances, or transaction histories.

Monero works like any other currency but with some privacy and decentralization innovations.

Monero uses {{< link href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stealth-address-cryptocurrency.asp" content="stealth addresses" >}}. Alongside with {{< link href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringsignatures.html" content="ring signatures" >}} and {{< link href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringCT.html" content="ring ct's" >}} to "hide" the transaction and transaction amounts. To enhance transaction privacy. In order to decentralize the network further monero uses the  {{< link href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/randomx.html" content="RandomX algorithm" >}} in order to further discourage use of asics.

# The main problems with bitcoin and other cryptos
Bitcoin may seem like a perfect currency. However under the hood bitcoin has many flaws.

One of the main problems with bitcoin is that it isn't actually censorship resistant. A central bank or government can blacklist your address and block exchanges from accepting it. While there are ways to get around that it isn't easy. Monero on the other hand is censorship resistant as it doesn't display transaction amounts or receivers.

Another problem with bitcoin and other PoW currencies is that they are actually controlled by a small amount of people since they are really hard to mine among with many other factors. Monero is a relatively easy currency to mine and is ASIC resistant which makes it even more decentralized as anyone with a computer and an internet connection can start contributing to the network.

Bitcoin has a block size limit which results in more expensive transactions and longer waiting time. Monero uses a {{< link href="https://localmonero.co/knowledge/dynamic-block-size" content="dynamic block size" >}}

Also bitcoin has a {{< link href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3m" content="high block time" >}} which means that transactions take longer to be confirmed and executed. Bitcoins block time is ~10 minutes while {{< link href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/monero-confirmationtime.html#3y" content="monero's block time" >}} is ~2 minutes

With bitcoin and many other cryptos halving occurs approximately every 4 years. This however is a double edged sword because not halving the rewards will result in constant inflation and infinity supply. On the other hand by halving rewards miners are less motivated to secure the network. Monero has chosen to keep the block rewards at a constant 0.6 xmr reward, thus securing that miners will keep on mining. This inflation however is very easily predicted.

Like any other technology, right now monero is being used for illegal activity. Mostly because of its privacy additions. This haslead to a ~600k bounty by the irs (https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/09/14/irs-will-pay-up-to-625000-if-you-can-crack-monero-other-privacy-coins/)

# Conclusion
Monero is basicly what people think bitcoin is. Heres a great vid about it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak5TFr26BaE).
