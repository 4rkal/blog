In this article I will tell you why monero fits my views of what a cryptocurrency should look like.

# What is monero?
Monero is a decentralized cryptocurrency. It uses a public distributed ledger with privacy-enhancing technologies that obfuscate transactions to achieve anonymity and fungibility. Observers cannot decipher addresses trading monero, transaction amounts, address balances, or transaction histories.

Monero works like any other currency but with some privacy and decentralization innovations.

Monero uses {{< link href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stealth-address-cryptocurrency.asp" content="stealth addresses" >}}. Alongside with {{< link href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringsignatures.html" content="ring signatures" >}} and {{< link href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringCT.html" content="ring ct's" >}} to "hide" the transaction and transaction amounts. To enhance transaction privacy. In order to decentralize the network further monero uses the  {{< link href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/randomx.html" content="RandomX algorithm" >}} in order to further discourage use of asics.

# The main problems with bitcoin and other cryptos
Bitcoin may seem like a perfect currency. However under the hood bitcoin has many flaws.

One of the main problems with bitcoin is that it isn't actually censorship resistant. A central bank or government can blacklist your address and block exchanges from accepting it. While there are ways to get around that it isn't easy. Monero on the other hand is censorship resistant as it doesn't display transaction amounts or receivers.

Another problem with bitcoin and other PoW currencies is that they are actually controlled by a small amount of people since they are really hard to mine among with many other factors. Monero is a relatively easy currency to mine and is ASIC resistant which makes it even more decentralized as anyone with a computer and an internet connection can start contributing to the network.

Bitcoin has a block size limit which results in more expensive transactions and longer waiting time. Monero uses a {{< link href="https://localmonero.co/knowledge/dynamic-block-size" content="dynamic block size" >}}

Also bitcoin has a {{< link href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3m" content="high block time" >}} which means that transactions take longer to be confirmed and executed. Bitcoins block time is ~10 minutes while {{< link href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/monero-confirmationtime.html#3y" content="monero's block time" >}} is ~2 minutes

Bitcoin has halving once every 4 years. The halving halves the amount mined (printed) bitcoin in every block. This by itself increases price volatility and transaction fee volatility.

Monero has chosen 0.6 XMR block reward forever. Any good currency want to have as little volatility as possible. Monero is a currency not a "number go up coin".
# Conclusion
Monero is basicly what people think bitcoin is. Heres a great vid about it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak5TFr26BaE).
